Hello hello welcome everybody. Welcome to our session Automation in Action Strategies for Risk Management. My name is Nida Wu. I am a worldwide specialist business architect with cloud operations and focusing on systems manager resource management which is resources. Explore tagging and also cloud governance and today I'm here with my friend. Yeah, hi everyone, I'm Baishhu Kadambi. I'm a worldwide partner specialist covering cloud ops management so what Narita does but for partners and yeah we're really excited today to talk about automated risk mitigation. Shall we get started? OK. Um, great, so why are we here, right? What's the context of this talk? Well, humans can react in 200 milliseconds, modern cyber threats operate at machine speed, as all of you guys know, but threat actors increasingly leverage automation in their attacks, making manual responses insufficient to maintain effective security, organizations need automated security controls and remediation capabilities that can detect, respond, and mitigate threats in real time. This is why AWS cloud operations emphasizes automated security tooling such as auto remediation through event triggers and centralized security management to stay ahead of potential threats. OK, now I'm gonna go through the NIST risk management framework. So risk assessment is one of the fundamental components of an organizational risk management process as described by NIST Special publication. Risk assessments are used to identify, estimate, and prioritize risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, and other organizations. The purpose of risk assessments is to inform. Decision makers, um, and support risk responses by identifying one relevant threats to organizations or threats directed through organizations 2 vulnerabilities both internal and external to the organization 3 impact or harm to organizations that may occur, uh, given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities and lastly likelihood that harm will occur. The end result is the determination of risk. The NIS uh risk management framework as you can see here provides a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information security categorization, control selection, implementation and assessment system and common, uh, control authorizations and continuous monitoring the RMF framework up here. Uh, includes activities to prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. Amazing. I'll hand it over to Narita. Now, before I start, how many of you have to abide by a regulatory framework? Alright, majority of us, right, not just in this, but there's always PCI, any other regulatory framework, and this could be applicable to everything and where we start that journey is really the type of controls. Now the different types of controls defined within the regulatory framework, right? So there are well control is a rule that is evaluating your configurations based on something that you desire. Now that could be either in different services, but in this sense we start with preventative controls. Now these preventative controls are think of them as your first line of defense, and these are allowing or preventing an event from recurring. Now when when we focus on proactive controls, this is pretty much thinking about if your resource is compliant with your policy and objectives uh before their provision. So taking that uh proactive approach before that resource is provisioned. And then we go into detective controls. Once that resource is provisioned, what happens that we're able to detect that configuration meets our standards, right? This is kind of universal that we've seen through all our different controls and throughout our sessions that reinforce. And when we think of preventative controls we're thinking about service control policies with organizations that are either allowing or disallowing you to provision a resource, let's say for S3 disallowing for you to create any buckets that have public access or we're thinking about proactive controls where if you're using infrastructure as code, primarily, you know, cloud formation. You have a way and an ability to use confirmation hooks that says I do not want you to provision a resource that say has no encryption. We want EC2 or EBS volumes to be encrypted. You can use a proactive control to not allow that resource to make it to the end of the CIC pipeline altogether. Or when it comes to detective controls, how many people use config? Good amount of people use configG, right? and config is one of our main services where you are creating these different rules for your environments that abide to the certain desired state of that configuration and so config is more of a detective control of when that resource is actually deployed. How can you detect it it's meeting those standards and a control that most people don't think about that I don't have on here is a responsive control. So what happens after that resource has been configured. What do you have to remediate? How long do you have to have that control or that configuration available in your account that you do not desire, right? And so when we think of establishing really an effective strategy for this any compliance framework, it's really looking at these different type of controls and layering them, right? It's not one or the other it's thinking about which one makes the most sense for that workload and. When you think of, let's say the first line of defense, which is preventative. This is really helping from those unauthorized configuration changes or access controls and then you're building that up with detective and responsive controls detect that resource remediate that resource and proactive is just the complementary of it all together to pull that in all together from the different workloads. So when we think about when do we implement these controls, we're really thinking about. From the moment that workload is live, what is the severity or the impact of that workload? So if that workload is a critical workload, you wanna make sure you have the different controls that are complementing it. So maybe you have a standard controls that say yes this account and workload can only have, but as you build up to the different impacts of that workload, you're adding additional and more security focus or compliance focus to give you a full end to end. And when we think of how does that look like in our shift left culture. We're thinking about that how do we implement that? How many of you guys use CIC pipelines from authoring your code exactly, right? That is our strategy when we want to. We don't want to manually deploy resources. We wanna do that through a pipeline altogether. So when we think of this whole end to end solution, product controls are gonna be really, uh, when you are building out those resources and then proactive is when you're deploying those reserves. And then detective is really at the very end of this staging. Now why do we wanna focus on shift left? It's a big topic as well that reinforced and it's really focusing on being a little more effective when it comes to these different strategies, um. When you detect misconfigurations ahead of time you're reducing that experience or that friction of at the end when you're monitoring it, right? You don't want to deploy a whole application and then have to revert back or do a roll back because it didn't meet certain compliance. You wanna make sure from the moment that you are building that code you are already standardizing between different teams what is great, what is not. And so when we think of like proactive controls down there when we're deploying it that is really focusing on making sure that if there's anything to do you're already doing that ahead of time so think of those whole cloud formation hooks you're saying no I don't want those S3 buckets made public. I want to cry encryption already within my code and you're making sure that throughout each process it's where you need to make those configuration changes in those desired states. So let's align this to the different toolings and the different services that make up a CIC pipeline, right? You have services like Amazon Q Developer. I'm gonna ask a funny question. Who hasn't heard of Amazon Q Developer? I That's a rare one. It's a good one. I actually was thinking 100%, but yes, you know, we have Amazon Q developer that is, you know, a generative AI assistant really that is helping you develop your code and find, uh, secure or implement security scans and transform your code to understand what is it meeting and make suggestions based on it, right? Or we have, uh, services like Amazon Codeguru. Anybody use Codeguru? Alright, this is actually a pretty good one because think of Amazon Coal grew as a application security testing tool, right? Think of combining machine learning and automated uh testing to really identify vulnerabilities. Estylish best practices into your code altogether. So instead of you having to validate it by yourself or think this meets standards, but is it really meeting standards you're able to use Amazon code security to kind of help you build out that um that status of what is happening and track that all together. And then how do you combine all these different services is kind of looking at Code Catalyst. Anybody heard of Amazon Code Catalyst? All right, this is uh this is one of our newer products, right? Or one of our first products that we launched altogether. Now this is a way for you to set up that foundation. So how many of you know how to fully code? That is actually rare. Majority of people do not know how to code, right? Sometimes if you have the old school guys, they know how to or old school people actually they, they all know how to code, but sometimes you need. A blueprint on how to code and how to establish, you know, what is needed. CodeC Catalyst works with Amazon Q developer and builds out a whole blueprint for you to be able to build out an application or build some guardrails all together. Put in your CIC pipeline to bring it, um, as a true end to end phasing altogether. And then once we establish all these different uh services then we think about monitoring the after thing, right? When I talked about response controls are always the afterthought, we wanna start using services like systems manager to be able to remediate any remediations that need to be done for that resource. So if a resource becomes noncompliant, what are you doing right away or taking as a manual action altogether? And I do wanna talk about Gentech AI or Genit AI beyond those different services, right? So when we think about, you know, Gentech AI for managing risk, we're thinking about using Bedrock and what you can use with within Bedrock is create your own different agents, right? If we start off at the bottom right hand corner where we talk about us as an operations team, we can provide bedrock different. Data sets or different inputs for them to evaluate our resource so in this case we're gonna use let's say audit manager. Audit manager is the ability for you to look at any compliance framework. And understand the different controls that are tied to that framework and pump in different data from different services into it to be able to say where do you stand let's say for NIS or PCI or any of the different regulatory frameworks it has and so what we do here. Is by leveraging uh bedrock we are creating a way for it to validate what is in our environment and taking observations within the environment and you can create an agent that says is focused on compliance or let's say operations and they can communicate to say hey. Is it valid? Is it not valid? Can you see what I have in my account? All the different configu rules that are within my account? And let's say I'm using the N uh framework and I might be missing some controls. You could tell Bedrock as an agent to say what are some different rules. Rules that I could be missing it could create those rules it could deploy those rules altogether and then also that last part of response remediation and be able to ultimately remediate any of those uh resources that have already been uh deployed and then it doesn't match what we're looking for. So this all in all is kind of like a little gist of how you can use genitive AI gente AI for risk management altogether. There's more strategies when it comes. There's also best practices with it and also how our partners can help you alleviate that, right? Sometimes we don't have the knowledge or we don't have the manpower, and this is where partners come into play, which Bhu is gonna talk to us about. Yeah, thank you so much, Narita so. Um, are there any partners around here? Partner, partner, partner? OK, so you guys could all work with a partner maybe, um, but yeah, I just wanted to spend some time talking about partners while Narita did a great job explaining everything about automating risk mitigation, right? Like some of this is really challenging and you might need help. So that's where partners, especially our cloud ops competency partners, can come in and implement these solutions for you. So let me first give you an overview of the AWS cloud ops competency program. Our validated partners offer comprehensive solutions across 5 key solution areas. As you can see here, it's cloud governance, cloud financial management, monitoring and observability, uh, compliance and auditing and operations management. Me and Narita cover operations management, so it's very, very cool, also known as AWS cloud operations. Yeah. Um, for automated risk mitigation specifically, right, what we learned today, you can see how partners integrate across multiple of our solution areas, particularly cloud governance, uh, compliance, and operations management. What's important is that all these partner solutions have been, uh, thoroughly vetted literally by like our technical and business counter like our team and validated by AWS to ensure that they can support your cloud operations needs at scale. Alright, there's a lot up here, but, uh, I just wanted to show you the cloud operations competency framework. Um, we have two different paths, one for service partners, so like consulting or professional service partners, and then also, um, there's an ISP one which we'll show you next, but. Um, these two paths enable organizations to implement cloud operations based on their specific requirements and capabilities. While both paths provide the same five core solution areas, they differ on delivery modes. Um, this dual path approach along with the comprehensive solution areas was developed in direct response to customer needs and operational, um, challenges in managing AWS environments. So like I mentioned, this is. For the services path and then this one is the uh software path for ISVs right so same solution areas different categories underneath and I just wanted to spend a little bit more time on the ISV or the software path right? so today we talked about automating risk mitigation and I wanted to show you a concrete example of how our partners can create value by integrating multiple solution areas so. We gave an example of Hay Corp's terraform solution and they combined elements from cloud governance like centralized identity. And security management as well as secure high performing and resilient foundations and then they also do operations management capabilities for automated controls deployment as well as compliance and auditing features to maintain security requirements. What's powerful about this integration is that customers can automate their infrastructure deployment while maintaining security and compliance guard rails, which is exactly why we were like what we were discussing earlier with automated risk mitigation. Their solution handles everything from the initial secure infrastructure deployment through ongoing compliance management. This is just one example of our our cloud operations competency partners can help implement the automation strategies that we discussed earlier earlier in a validated and proven way. Amazing, so. I know you're like super convinced right to work with competency partners but in case you need some more data, right, um, it's helpful for customers to prioritize cloud operations as well as partners so as you can see, um. There's a high customer impact, lots of numbers you're welcome to read them, but as you can see it's a good ROI right? um, there's reduced time to market. It's good for the environment, which is always good, um, and then also it helps with talent productivity. And it leads to less downtime for customers and there's also a really good partner opportunity um which uh it translates to faster growth, higher impact, higher demand, and as well as, um, for every dollar spent on AWS solutions partners can generate $6.40 in additional revenue, so lots of goodness, cloud operations, OK. Um, and if you're still not convinced, I know there are no partners in the crowd, but um, if you join our competency program, we have a lot of different benefits we provide. Uh, there's some that are specific to cloud operations, but some of them are pretty standardized like, um, you get MDF right marketing funds to use, um, some specific ones for this competency though would be the partner advisory board where we pick the top cloud operations partners and they get exclusive access to roadmap and. You know, product teams they can give us feedback also partner which is great. It's a live, um, enablement session which is also exclusively for cloud operations competency partners. So these are all the benefits if you are a partner, please join if you have a valid solution, but yeah. That's it. These are resources for, uh, the things Narita talked about if you wanna just add about that. Yeah, if anything, um, compliance and assurance of AI systems, this is gonna really focus more on you developing that strategy when you do any, uh, gendered AI or AI agents. The compliance workshop is gonna walk you through some of our scenarios of how to implement different controls in your environment. And then Amazon Bedrock and Security and privacy just goes over the overview of Bedrock and then our best practices for Gen AI we just came out with this framework and it just goes beyond, you know, implementing those services, but what does it mean to have those different applications and like just like what she was saying, if you are interested in meeting a partner or exploring the partner that we do have a village right behind us in the back. Back at aisle 1400 talking about different partners that we have and it's beyond cloud operations. There's different uh partners that help for different use cases so thank you so much yeah you can also look at our public URL page or if you're a partner and want to become specialized you can look at that second QR code. But yeah, visit us at our booth we have swag and fun. And great great swag backpacks, water bottles, smiles. OK, great. That's it. Thank you so much for your time. Connect with us on LinkedIn. Thank you.
