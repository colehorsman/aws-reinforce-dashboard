Key components include: API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, DynamoDB, and **Amazon Bedrock**.\n\n**Controls and Features by Domain:**\n\n**Accuracy:** Ensuring outputs are correct and credible.\n\n**Tool:** The **Model Evaluation** feature in Amazon Bedrock is crucial. It allows you to run jobs against your model using predefined or custom datasets to score its performance on metrics like accuracy and toxicity.\n\n**Fairness:** Addressing and mitigating bias and discrimination.\n\n**Concept:** The session introduces the idea of a **Bias Assessment** to evaluate training data and model outputs for potential bias.\n\n**Practice:** Define **Prohibited Policies**â€”clear boundaries for what the application is not allowed to do (e.g., generate harmful content). Then, create tests to validate these policies are enforced.\n\n**Privacy:** Protecting personally identifiable information (PII). This relies on strong data governance practices.'

Providing example phrases is optional but can improve accuracy.\n\n**Content Filters**: Can be configured separately for prompts and responses. Each of the six categories can be set to a filter strength of `low`, `medium`, or `high`, with `high` being the most aggressive.\n\n**PII / Sensitive Information**: Supports a list of common, predefined PII types (e.g., email address, name). Users can also create custom sensitive information types by providing a name and a regular expression (regex) pattern (e.g., for a "Booking ID"). The behavior for detected PII can be set to either `block` the entire interaction or `mask` (redact) the sensitive data in the output.\n\n**Testing**: The Bedrock console includes a testing interface where a created guardrail can be tested against any supported foundation model. The test console shows the final response and a trace detailing which specific policy was violated.\n\n**API Integration**: Guardrails are applied when invoking a Bedrock model through the `InvokeModel` or `InvokeModelWithResponseStream` API calls, acting as a wrapper around the model. They can also be directly associated with an Agent in its configuration.'

The talk focuses on the middle ground, Amazon Bedrock.\n\n**AI-Specific IR Framework**: Traditional incident response is augmented with a model that considers the unique components of an AI workload: the organization, compute infrastructure, the AI/ML application itself (models and training data), private data, and users.\n\n**Seven Elements of Investigation**: An incident is analyzed across seven elements:\n\n**Logging is Critical**: Effective incident response is impossible without proper logging. AWS CloudTrail is essential for control plane activity. For the data plane of AI apps, **Model Invocation Logging** in Amazon Bedrock is paramount to capture prompts and responses.\n\n**Preparation is Key**: Have an incident response plan that is tested and specifically includes your AI workloads. Ensure you have the right people, processes, and technology (especially logging) in place *before* an incident occurs.\n\n**Isolate and Analyze**: During an incident, a key step is to isolate the compromised application (e.g., using security groups or network ACLs) to prevent further damage while analysis continues.',

This is the primary source of evidence for detecting prompt injection, data exfiltration attempts, and model misuse.

It provides the definitive log of all API calls, allowing you to quickly determine who did what, to which resource, and when.\n\n**Security Hub for Prioritization**: In a crisis, AWS Security Hub is invaluable for quickly assessing your security posture. It automatically scans your environment, aggregates findings, and assigns a severity rating, allowing you to prioritize the most critical issues first.\n\n**Think in Least Privilege**: A recurring theme is the principle of least privilege. Developers should spend more time thinking about who *doesn''t* need access than who does. Granting `s3:*` is easy but dangerous; granting only `s3:GetObject` is more secure.\n\n**Use IaC for Repeatable Security**: Frameworks like AWS SAM, CDK, and SST allow you to define your infrastructure as code. This makes your deployments repeatable, auditable, and allows you to codify security best practices into reusable patterns.\n\n**Favor Short-Term Credentials**: Long-lived IAM user access keys are a significant risk. The talk strongly advocates for using temporary credentials wherever possible, such as by assuming a role via the STS `AssumeRole` API or using IAM database authentication for RDS.\n\n**Secure Data Access Patterns**: Instead of making S3 buckets public, use **S3 presigned URLs** to grant temporary, time-limited access to specific objects.',

This avoids making the object or bucket public.\n\n**IAM Database Authentication for RDS**: Connect to an RDS database using temporary credentials obtained via an IAM role instead of a hardcoded password.\n\n**Short-Term Credentials with STS**: Use the AWS Security Token Service (STS) `AssumeRole` API call to grant temporary, time-limited access to services. This is preferable to creating IAM users with long-lived keys.\n\n**AWS Secrets Manager**: Store secrets centrally and retrieve them at runtime using an IAM role.

It always sends a scan status event to EventBridge for every object scanned.\n\n**Tag-Based Access Control**: You can implement a bucket policy that denies `s3:GetObject` unless the object has the tag `GuardDutyMalwareScanStatus` with the value `NO_THREATS_FOUND`, effectively blocking access to files until they are scanned and confirmed clean.\n\n**Quarantine Workflow**: A common pattern is to use an EventBridge rule to trigger a Lambda function when a `Threats found` event occurs. The Lambda function can then copy the malicious object to a separate, restricted "quarantine" bucket and delete the original.\n\n**Cross-Account Management**: A delegated GuardDuty administrator can enable and configure malware protection for any bucket in any member account within the AWS Organization. A sample CloudFormation StackSet is provided to automate deployment across the organization.\n\n**Prerequisites**: The only prerequisite is an S3 bucket using a synchronous storage class. The feature can be used standalone without enabling the rest of GuardDuty.'
