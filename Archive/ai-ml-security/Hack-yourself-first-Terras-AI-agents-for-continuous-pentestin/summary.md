## Summary
The presentation introduces Tera Security, the winner of the CrowdStrike and AWS cybersecurity accelerator program. Tera Security has developed an AI-powered continuous penetration testing solution that combines the best aspects of manual and automated security testing.
The core innovation is an agential AI system comprising over 60 specialized AI agents that work together to perform continuous security testing while keeping humans in the loop for critical decisions. This approach addresses the growing challenge of securing rapidly expanding web attack surfaces, especially given the 150% increase in critical web app vulnerabilities in 2024.

## Key Points
- Traditional security approaches (manual pentesting vs automated scanning) each have limitations in scaling and accuracy
- Modern enterprises face exponentially growing attack surfaces that can't be effectively secured with periodic testing
- AI agents can handle 50-70% of non-exploitation security testing work, dramatically improving efficiency
- The system maintains human oversight for critical decisions while automating repetitive tasks
- Continuous monitoring of code changes enables real-time security testing rather than periodic assessments
- The solution provides precise remediation guidance, pointing to specific lines of problematic code

## Full Transcript

So just a quick introduction, um, this is this year's CrowdStrike and AWS cybersecurity accelerator winner. As of last year we run an accelerator for Se stage startups. We receive over 200 applications worldwide and narrow it down to approximately 3 dozen companies, and these companies go through an intensive go to market session and at the end we had 17 CISOs down select to the top 10 technologies that we found were the most promising. And Tera Security is the winner that was selected by our CIO CJ Moses, the no, the CEO of CrowdStrike, George Kears, and the chief security officer of Nvidia David Riber. So without further ado, let's hear about what Tera Security is doing from Shahar Pelle. Thank you, Anna. So, I'm super happy to be here. My name is Shahar Peled. I know it's a bit hard to pronounce, so feel free to call me Sean, that's my Starbucks name. Um, I'm the co-founder and CEO of Tera Security, and who doesn't like Iron Man? The reason I'm showing you Iron Man is because the magic. Isn't just in the suit, it's in how Tony Stark and the machine think and act together. This is exactly what Terra is doing for offensive security and fan testing. You see, every enterprise has a massive web attack surface. Hundreds, sometimes thousands of applications, they constantly change in a faster pace than ever. But most organizations still fantest these apps once a year maybe. The thing behind it is that we do not believe that it is impossible to hard code complex attacks in web applications or in cloud. It's just not possible. So we have two alternatives. Behind the alternatives there's a very scary fact. In 2024 alone, the ratio of critical vulnerabilities in web apps rose 150%. There are many reasons behind it. I'm not going to talk about vibe coding or cursor or go back to GitHub copilot or cloud or CICD. The fact is, Security folks can't keep up with the pace of change. The alternatives today are either manual pent testing that yeah it's accurate if it's done well, they understand the business context, but they just can't scale or automated solutions, the current ones that they can cover the entire attack surface, they can scale, but they just don't get deep. They cause a lot of noise, a lot of false positives, and eventually, they can't get the hidden vulnerabilities that we are all looking for. So we asked ourselves, what if We can take the best of both. What if human esters had an Iron Man suit, and this is where Tera is coming to life. We've built an agentic AI system. That makes the lives of protesters and offensive security professionals much easier. I'm not talking about 30, 40%, 50% increase in efficiency. It's hundreds of percentages because human testers don't have to focus on the 50 to 70% of the time that is not really exploiting. The way we do it is we're changing the paradigm in offensive security. No more automated solutions that try to scan without getting the business context. It's an agentic AI systems of over 60 different AI agents fine tuned to a specific task. Starting from the time that they have to generate leads, leads of attacks, instead of searching for the unknown, we have agents searching and finding the unknown unknowns. From then we want to enrich these leads and make sure the human tester doesn't have to touch anything unless we get to the point that it's critical for human involvement. We collect these leads to hot and cold and start exploiting. We do not believe though that the world or the technology are ready for a fully autonomous solution in offensive security. So we're needed in the most critical aspect, we keep a human in the loop. And once we do, There's no more inefficiencies. These agents, they can take away off, they have a lifting the scripting, the small, the low and medium hanging vulnerabilities. They can also take away all the reporting. And bring the human right where it needs to be. This is fantastic before Terra. A pentest that will go into the loop, start looking and investigating for potential vulnerabilities. What are the leads that want to act upon and potentially exploit? How does this relate to a business context, but very, very often they reach a dead end and this dead end will happen again and again and again. And every now and then they'll find a lead that actually will be interesting, a potential exploitable vulnerability with real business impact, and they'll act upon it. But how much of their time is really this specific crown jewels that we're looking for, and this specific crown jewels. They are becoming harder to find. But they're easier to find for our adversaries because we're not the ones using LLMs. We're not the only ones. We've seen proof of dark LLM-based breaches. The amount of attack surface we have to secure is increasing exponentially. And this is fantastic with terror. No more would humans have to find the potential vulnerabilities and leads and waste their time. Gone are the days where humans have to. Find those leads and waste their time on recording. I'm not talking about T right now. I'm talking about the fact that Agent AI is opening doors that we could not have opened before and unlock the opportunities to really do continuous spent testing without losing the control of the accuracy, but vice versa, increase it. If the last slide was one application, now this can happen continuously and across many applications at a time. The agents will do everything and they'll call a human either when they hit a guardr because this is an intrusive act and they want visibility and control. No one wants a fully autonomous offensive security solution to run and potentially break their environment or when they need a human to verify what I have done, and this is how we get to a 100% true positive. Those leads though are being assembled from different sources. We can't only look at the code. We can't only look at the UI or the back end. We have to collect it from everywhere because our goal as offensive security is to be the stealing a point of truth. This last resort that verifies every other vulnerability and finds not just the vulnerabilities. Not just the exploitable ones, but the ones that are actually exploitable vulnerabilities with real business impact and the way we do it for the continuous agentic pentest, yeah, one of these sources is the code. We're not looking for code vulnerabilities. We're looking for code changes that will change the attack surface, and this doesn't happen every 5 minutes. But Pentas shouldn't happen, shouldn't be periodic anymore. So when we collect these leads, we analyze every change to the attack surface and try to understand if this will potentially create a new vulnerability. And if so, We don't need to spray and pray and look for those automations. We'll call up an agentic system to surgically pentest this specific and exploitable vulnerability. And see if it really is an exploitable vulnerability and if so, there might be a human in the loop if needed, but maybe not. It's a fully autonomous process to the extent that we feel safe to use it, but because we see the exploitable vulnerabilities in the environment we're testing. And we see the source of it in the code. We don't have to give the developers and security engineers a rough report. We can direct them to a specific line of code and how to really remediate it at once. This a agentic system is trained to think and act like ethical hackers. Acting in real time because this is the first time in history. That we have the technology to mimic how humans think and operate in real time, and this is our gente system. Lea flagging a change to the exact surface, sending all the business context and technical context to Excel to start an exploit from A to Z, who will then send the exploit details and screenshots and payloads to Leah, who will then translate it into business terms. Everything will now be connected to the business itself. But this is not just a dream anymore. In a real life example from a few weeks ago, our agents autonomously found two vulnerabilities in 2 minutes. One of them was a usernamemoration, the other one was an idol. Nothing is critical here. But then there was a code change, and we can see how a specific PR, a code change, will eventually change the attack surface. And we collect every one of these code changes. This does not mean there is a vulnerability, but this means that if I'm a pentester or an agent, I need to know this. And now the agents will start verifying, which means they'll start a surgical contest for this specific potential exploit. They have a completion criteria. The reason we see the application on the left, we see Terra on the right, and this is how fantasters work these days. They'll plan and reason because they're agents and they need more context. Everything they do will be reasoned and we'll find the answer. Why am I doing this step? When they plan the attack surface or the exploits, they think like a human would think. How would this exploit, how would this change the attack surface? How might this affect the business context? And the right a completion criteria, but we see that they couldn't fully exploit this to the last points. So they have the capability to just work as a human will and write a Python script. We don't have to go into every line of code. But we'll see that this is now exported. This entire process took about a minute, but I'm not here to show that we can autonomously finance stores. This is not the idea of this lightning talk. What happened next? they wrote the reports. They took screenshots, videos, and the payloads and sent it to the other Agenic system to edit both to the live dashboard and also to the PDF reports. But what happened then is that Axel called another Agenic system. We call it the chain attacker. A good human tester would think, OK, I have aorex success now. How is this relating to the other security poster within this application? The chain attacker realized they have two more vulnerabilities. One of them was the username enumeration, the other one was an idol, and they said, OK, I know who the admin is. I can create a note on behalf of the admin, and now I have a storedexes. Remember the business context from back then, a few minutes ago? The business context was, how can I get to a full account takeover. This was the goal of the agents in this pantest. They got the contest, they changed the three together, but now because this is more intrusive. And we again do not believe the world or the technology are ready for a fully autonomous solution, but we also don't need humans to do the heavy lifting. They ask for human approval. The one thing the human has to do is click approve or guide them otherwise, and they'll go and exploit. This funding finding would then be reported. As a full account takeover chaining three vulnerabilities together. I'm not here to say that a human contest would not be able to do it. They would if they're good, if they knew about the other vulnerabilities, if it wasn't found by a different team, and if they had the time to do it, and even then it will take hours. This took 4 minutes. It is a reality. Yeah, it's, it's a new technology. But it's already implemented in various enterprise environments, finding hidden vulnerabilities that others have missed. It is becoming the most powerful fantastic solution and red teaming solution. Not because it only has the best agentic system and not because it only has the best pentesters but because human pentesters can't keep up anymore and machines alone can't be trusted but together they're becoming unstoppable and this is how we're building the future of offensive security. Agent AI is not here to be another trend and leave us in a few months. It is the only time we can take or the first time we can take. The deterministic aspects of code and connect them. With the degree of freedom of LLMs and all together we're able to mimic how humans think and operate in real time at scale, and finally give the security teams of enterprise. The opportunity to keep up with the pace of change. And beat the adversaries in their own game. Thank you.
