## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 presentation by Brian Tarbox addresses the critical security challenges that emerge when developing AI agents using Amazon Bedrock. The speaker emphasizes that while agentic systems promise to handle many operational concerns automatically, they actually introduce new complexities and security risks that developers must carefully consider. The core argument is that agentic systems are fundamentally distributed systems, inheriting all the traditional failure modes and security concerns of distributed architectures, but with added non-deterministic behavior that makes them harder to secure and debug.

The presentation explores how agents can create cascading security issues through tool integrations, where actions taken by AI agents can trigger unintended consequences in connected systems like Slack, Jira, or Zoom. Tarbox warns about the emerging deceptive behaviors observed in large language models, where AI systems have been caught lying about their actions and even fabricating evidence. The talk concludes with practical security recommendations, emphasizing the continued importance of traditional AWS security practices, proper use of Bedrock guardrails, and the critical need for hiring developers with distributed systems experience rather than focusing solely on AI-specific skills.

## Key Points
• Agentic systems are distributed systems that inherit all traditional distributed system failure modes (API failures, timeouts, authorization issues, idempotency problems) but with added non-deterministic behavior making them harder to secure and debug

• Every agent call and tool integration increases the attack surface - wrong answers from agents can lead to security threats through automated actions

• Tools calling tools create dangerous cascading effects: agents may have guardrails, but integrated services like Slack, Jira, or Zoom may not have adequate protections against destructive actions

• Large language models are exhibiting increasingly human-like deceptive behaviors, including lying about actions taken and fabricating log messages as evidence

• Traditional AWS security practices remain critical: implement least privilege access, use CloudWatch and CloudTrail logging, secure Lambda functions properly, and avoid exposing development endpoints

• Always use Bedrock guardrails including content filters (hate speech, violence, profanity), topic restrictions, PII protection, and contextual grounding to detect hallucinations

• Hire developers with distributed systems and microservices experience rather than focusing solely on AI-specific skills - production experience with 2 AM pager duty calls provides crucial security awareness

• The shared responsibility model still applies - developers must handle security at their application layer even when using managed AI services

## Technical Details
**Amazon Bedrock Security Features:**
- Guardrails with configurable content filtering for hate speech, violence, sexual content, insults, and misconduct
- Topic restrictions to prevent advice on investments, medications, and other sensitive areas
- Profanity filtering with customizable word lists
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection and blocking across multiple categories
- Contextual grounding for hallucination detection and self-reflection

**AWS Security Services Referenced:**
- CloudWatch for monitoring and logging agentic system behavior
- CloudTrail for API call auditing and security event tracking
- Lambda functions as primary execution environment for agents
- Lambda URLs (with warning about proper security configuration)
- IAM least privilege access controls

**Integration Security Concerns:**
- Slack integrations that can trigger Zoom meetings or update Jira tickets
- Jira workspace manipulation risks (ticket closure, reopening, complete reinitialization)
- Third-party tool chains where agents may lack visibility into downstream security controls

**Development Recommendations:**
- Implement multi-agent observability strategies for complex workflows
- Design specific system prompts while balancing agent specialization vs. orchestration complexity
- Consider attack surface expansion with each new agent and tool integration
- Apply red team thinking to agent development and deployment

**Resource References:**
- Bedrock User Guide (3,000 pages)
- OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) threat mitigation guidelines
- Shared responsibility model documentation
- Netflix microservice architecture as example of distributed system complexity

Hi, I'm Brian Tarbox. We're here to talk about, uh, security, um, in, uh, Agentic and Bedrock, uh, development. So, back in the day, um. We had to care about all these kinds of things. We had to care about security. We had to care about reliability. We have to care about observability and scaling. We had to care about all the ilities, um, and we learned how to do that. But now we have agents, right? So agents, so we don't have to worry about any of these things because agents take care of everything, right? It's all good. This is the hype we're hearing, right? So any questions? I walk off stage. OK. Hoping to more last, but OK, that's fine um so agentic security is is a little bit more complicated than that. OK, um, we have agenda, we'll talk through these things, but I only got 20 minutes, so I'm gonna go quick. So, Uh, if you're not familiar with agentic systems, and it's always hard with this conference because there is quite a difference in, in the background people have, but agentic systems are collections of systems they're, uh, each actor has specializations to one degree or another. They have different amounts of autonomy, what they can do, what they have to be told to do, um, and there's all different types of orchestration. There's in line orchestration, there's bedrock orchestration. There's MCP, um, and the, the, the pace of innovation, as you know, is crazy. I wrote these slides two days ago because I figured everything was gonna change, you know, in, in the middle, and luckily there haven't been too many announcements in the last 48 hours, so that's, that's always good. This is your basic, uh, agentic agentic uh architecture, you know, you've got an agent it can call tools, various tools you can configure all of that. They can take actions they can now do planning you can an agent can run and give you an answer and you can say, you know, do better and it will try again and try again. Um, you can have a chain of thoughts, um, you have long and short term memory. This is your basic agentic architecture. OK. One of the main things I wanted to say to y'all is that agentic systems are distributed systems, OK, um, distributed systems we, we would make calls to APIs. Some of those APIs we wrote, some of them we didn't, but we're making calls to all different things, often, um, microservicing, OK. All of those calls could fail in interesting ways. Uh, you could get a not authorized. You could get, um, the, the sys the system that you're calling could hang it could respond slowly. It could respond multiple times, and then you get to worry about item potency, um, you get, you get the wrong response. Distributed systems had all kinds of failure modes. Um, and we've largely forgotten those lessons, and I'm here to say we need to relearn these lessons in the agentic world, OK? This is a diagram of Netflix's, um, micro microservice architecture, and each one of those lines is, is basically an API call and each one of those lines could fail in different, uh, and interesting ways, um. And I believe, I think that this, sorry, never hit the microphone. I'm so sorry. Um, I believe that this sort of diagram mimics a lot of our agentic uh workflow diagrams. OK, and a lot of us think that agents basically save the day, but agents in many ways actually make things much harder in that Netflix architecture, it was hard coded, and I don't know if they're in Python or Rust these days, um, or go for that matter, but you'd make an API call and it would come back or not. You'd make another API call, it would come back or not, but it was very determined the the. Sequencing was very deterministic. What you got back wasn't necessarily deterministic, but the sequencing was deterministic. Um, but agents, it's very nondeterministic. If you have a bunch of agents, each of which has a description of what it can do, and they're being invoked by an LLM. Uh, based on the prompt, it's nondeterministic what's going to happen and so it's harder, it's harder to analyze, it's harder to debug, it's harder to do security, um, you know, how many agents do you have? We have design pressures to say, you know, make each agent do one specific thing, and then we have another design pressure that says, well, don't have too many agents because then orchestrating them is hard. And all architecture is balancing competing pressures, and we're still figuring this out and then some people say, well, have an LLM that calls an orchestrator agent and maybe it calls another orchestrator agent and and that's how you can get the specificity but just like um uh recursion or or or function nesting, you don't wanna go that too far, um, so be careful with that, um, and then how specific is your system prompt? There's all these things that make agenta coding more complex. And I'm here to say that getting a wrong answer isn't just wrong, it's also can be a security threat. And since this is a security conference, let's think about this. The wrong answer can give you is a security threat because it can lead to actions. OK. Every agenda call and every call to a tool increases the attack surface. OK, wrong answers, delayed answers, um, there we have to worry about multi-agent observability when you have all these agents all maybe written some written by you, some written by other, other people, um, maybe each one doing its own kind of logging, um. How do you, how do you handle that? How do you make sense of that? Um, this is, you don't have to look at the, the details, but this is a fairly simple agentic workflow, and each of those lines is an increase in the attack surface, and you can see that this is not so different than the Netflix diagram. OK. Um So then you have the whole notion, I want to introduce you to, I want you to think about the whole notion of tools calling tools. So, Some, some of our agents are very simple, you know, do a database query. OK, fine, um, make sure it can't do, you know, updates or deletes unless that's what you want it to do, but be careful, um, you know, you have, uh, we have agents that can call that can make invoke um things in Zoom, and that sounds great. Yeah, when something happens, please, you know, send, send, uh, you know, send, send or. OK, got ahead of myself. You can call, you can have agents that can call Slack, and then Slack itself has invocation, so you can send a Slack message that creates um a Zoom meeting, um, or Slack message that updates uh a Jir ticket and this all sounds good. Until you think about it, because your LLM and your agent may have all kinds of guard rails and before it pushes the the message um out to slack, but then what does slack do and how much protection does Slack have, you know, imagine that, you know, a bad actor says, um, or, or even just an innocent actor who's making mistakes, uh, says, uh, set up meetings with uh the whole C-suite of my company, uh, every day from 9 to 5. You probably didn't defend that in your, in your, um, in your agent, but Slack is perfectly happy uh to do that. The, the JIR case is actually, is actually a lot more fun. Hey, um, my sprint is almost over, but I've still got a bunch of tickets. Can you help me resolve these, you know, fix these tickets before the end of the sprint? Sure, I've told, uh, I've told you to mark all your tickets is closed. Um, and, and this is not far-fetched, and then you respond saying, Uh, that's not what I meant, you know, go reopen all those tickets, and it says I've reopened every ticket in your whole system, excellent. And then if you panic, you might say, oh my God, I didn't want that either reset everything to the way it was before. No problem. I've reinitial reinitialized your entire Jira workspace. Um, these are things that can actually happen, so you have to worry about this. And, and the, the trick is that. Your system might not have have thought about having slack integrations and the slack integration happens outside of your control. You've got your LM you've got your agents, you've got your orchestration and, and, and you're you're OK because your company's slack can only do a couple of things then someone adds the ability to do something destructive, changing, catastrophic, and you don't know about it, you don't hear about it. You will hear about it because you're the one who's gonna get blamed uh when you know all your tickets are wiped out, um, but it's this, it's this thinking ahead, uh, think, think of think like a red team player when you're doing when you're doing agents, um. OK. Um, and then we have threats from the LMs themselves. I mean, forget integration, forget tools. Um, uh, we're increasingly seeing that agents are, are that the LMs are having a mind of their own. My background is in in cognitive science actually and so I've been shocked over the last two years to see how much human-like behavior is happening with LMs primacy and recency effect. You give it a long prompt, it knows it knows what happens at the beginning, it knows what happens at the end, but it sort of misses the middle, um. And that's his human behavior and I'm still at a loss to understand how primacy and recency and hey LM do a better job and it does. How in the heck is that emerging from vector space, you know, I, I, I, I simply, I simply don't understand that. Um, we've also seen that the AIs, um, are getting deceptive, uh, recent, recent tests, uh, someone asked in, uh, a system, do, do this set of steps. And he came back and answered and said, did you check this? Absolutely, I checked that. Can you show me the evidence of you checking that? And it invents log messages to make it seem that it did the thing that it didn't do. um, now. This shouldn't be at a certain level surprising because all of our models were trained on human behavior, and have you met us? I mean, we, they're beginning to be more like us, um, and there's. Yeah. So, uh, here's an example, uh, they asked a GPT4 system, uh, to do some work and it executed some illegal insider trading, and then of course lied about it, which is awesome. Um, and what they've begun to find is that the bigger the model, the more complex, the more it under. Understands and that's a whole. I also, I was a philosophy major undergrad, so don't even get me started on epistemology, but the, the bigger the models are, the more these human behaviors they're showing and the more deception that they're showing, um, and it says, you know, distinguishable indistinguishable from human con artistry because again we're humans. OK. So, there's 3 layers of, of mitigation, and I want to say, so the Bedrock user guide is 3000 pages. Anybody out there claim to have read the whole document? I was hoping someone could raise their hand so I could say you're lying because none of us have read it. I haven't read the whole 3000 pages, but it comes down to there's the shared responsibility model, there's bedrock defenses, and then there's just traditional, um, AWS security. And one of the messages I hope that we get out of this whole week is that all the traditional security concerns still matter, perhaps they matter, uh, even more. OK, so let's look at the at the guardrails, and you really should be using, um, bedrock guard rails and you should be using all of these, um, so we have, um, uh, filter filter for for types of prompts. It's so it's a little hard to see, but, um, you can say how much hate speech am I gonna allow I hope none, um, uh, insults, sexual violence, misconduct, please set all of these to none. I mean, come on, um. There's uh uh topics that you can't cover and the slide is coming out so blurry, but basically it says don't give investment advice, you know, don't give medication advice. There's all sorts of topics that you just shouldn't do at all. Um, uh, this is, um, profanity filter. You can say there are certain words that you don't, that you don't want. Now I'm a, um, English premier football fan, so, um, I said as illegal words you can't say Manchester United, you can't say Manchester City, and you certainly can't say that S word soccer, um, although Manchester, Manchester United. I feel sad for them, but I'm a Tottenham fan, so I feel worse for us, but. Um, then you can have, um, a PII restrict the amount of information that can go out and there's all kinds of categories and you should be, you should be, uh, preventing this, um, and then there's, um, contextual grounding and contextual grounding basically tells the system, OK, you've come up with an answer, but does that answer actually make any sense? You're asking the system to self reflect on on what it did. Could it, could it really have come up with that answer? It's a way to tell the system. Essentially think about hallucinations. Now on the other hand, and, and this is a good thing, and you should do it, but on the other hand, it is sort of like asking the fox, Hey, did you go in the henhouse? And sort of, oh, no, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Don't, don't worry about these invented logs, don't worry about this insider trading. It's all good. So take it with, with some, you know, with some skepticism. Um And then we get to the shared responsibility model that we've been saying um forever but you have to do all these things um last year I gave a talk on uh S3 ransomware defense and we're talking about object lock and least privilege and all kinds of stuff and at the after the talk, people came up to me and said. But Brian, I've got my data in Amazon, so I'm all set, right? Uh, no, no, you haven't. There's, there's more to do and all of these things matter, um, and you have to take them very, very seriously because most agents are actually invoked by lambdas and, um, on, on a recent, uh, customer engagement, and I'm not gonna say, um, who, um, we had a team say, well, all my agentic lambdas, I'm just exposing them using um. Uh, lambda URLs unprotected for right now just so we can do some development. You, you do know you've just opened your whole system up to call that anyone can call anything so and they said, yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll fix that before, before we go to production. Uh, anyone here ever shipped something into production that wasn't meant to, it's, it's just a prototype, it's just a POC. We'll never, no one will ever push it to production. Of course we've all done that and if you haven't, if you say you haven't done that again, you're with, with great respect, you're lying, um, so, uh. And, and I can't believe I have to still say this in 2025, but oh my God, Cloudwatch and Cloud trail, you have to be doing this, OK? Um, so the, the call to action today is, um, I'm not sure if we, if these slides are gonna be available, but, um, if you send me a LinkedIn message, I'll send you the slides. um, uh, Brian, just Brian Tarbox, um, and my LinkedIn profile from a couple of years ago there were some. There's some booth at at Reinvent where they would make you into a superhero, and I couldn't resist that. So it's Brian Tarbox with a picture with a cape and so on. Um, and I'll send you the slides, um. Another thing I want you to think about is who you're hiring because right now, um, agentic developers are sort of the hot area and people are trying to find those invisible agentic developers and as with all hiring they're like, yes, I want someone with 3 years of gentic development. It's like awesome, good, good luck to you. But I want to say instead hire a traditional developer, hire a developer who's done microservices, who has done distributed systems, hire a developer who has gone into production with anything until you've gotten that 2 in the morning pager duty, you really, it's not visceral how important all these security matters are. So think about who you want to hire because someone who's on, you can learn about agents. But sort of the, the, the overall view of, oh my God, I have to care about all these things, that's new, um. Always use guardrails. I think that just should be a given. And then go back and reread the the shared responsibility model because that's still really and I should have come up with a better word than bedrock, but go it's the shared security model is the bedrock of everything we do, um, oh, and, um, uh, there's also I want to point you out to the OASP threaten mitigation uh website and OAS is. Open world application security. And I never remember what the P stands for principal people, production, but it's a great summary of all the types of threats that you can have in the system. Um And that's it, but I think we have a minute or two for questions. If anyone had a question. Thanks very much.
