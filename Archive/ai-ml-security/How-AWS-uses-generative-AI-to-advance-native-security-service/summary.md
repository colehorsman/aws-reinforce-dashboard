## Summary
The presentation focuses on how AWS is incorporating generative AI capabilities into its native security services. The speaker, Marshall Jones, a Security Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS, outlines three main approaches to generative AI in security: security of generative AI, generative AI for security, and security from AI-powered threats, with the presentation focusing primarily on generative AI for security.
The presentation details how AWS has integrated generative AI across multiple security domains, including development security, vulnerability management, configuration management, and threat detection. Key services discussed include Amazon Q Developer, Amazon Inspector, AWS Config, GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection, and Amazon Detective, all of which now leverage generative AI to enhance security operations and analysis.

## Key Points
- Generative AI is being integrated across AWS's native security services to enhance security operations and analysis
- Amazon Q Developer can be used for security testing and vulnerability remediation, not just development
- GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection now provides attack sequence findings, combining multiple security signals into comprehensive attack narratives
- AWS is focusing on making security tools more accessible through natural language interfaces
- Security automation and operational efficiency are being enhanced through AI-powered features
- The focus is on practical security applications rather than just theoretical AI capabilities
- Integration across multiple security services provides a more comprehensive security posture

## Technical Details
- Amazon Q Developer: Supports security testing, vulnerability scanning, and Guard Duty finding generation

## Full Transcript

So welcome everybody to uh TDR 322. We're gonna be discussing how AWS uses uh generative AI to advance kind of our native services. So first of all, my name is Marshall Jones. I'm a security specialist solutions architect at AWS. Uh, I've been at AWS roughly 6 years in a couple of different roles. I was a security consultant for a couple of years and then now I've been a security SA. For the last 4 years, which sounds crazy to say in my head, um, but I mainly focus kind of day to day on our detection and response services as a go to market function getting feedback back from our customers to help advance our native services, help our customers adopt and operationalize native services and kind of shape the future of what that looks like for our customers. And this one I'm gonna branch out a little bit more than detection and response we're gonna talk about all the different ways that you can take advantage of generative AI in our native services. So we're gonna start out with, uh, kinda how do you start securely and really fit this into a handful of different pillars? What should you think about from a management and governance perspective, automating security operations, security analytics, and security data analysis. And then one other housekeeping item, when this is over, I'll be on the side of the stage to answer any questions, um, but that's kind of how we have to handle that. So we're thinking about generative AI, uh, you might have seen this before, kind of 3 different generative AI use cases for security. The first one is security of generative AI. So think about you've got some generative AI application and you need to provide security around that. Generative AI for security, so using generative AI to uh uh create security outcomes and do something with security. And then security from threats powered by generative AI. So these are really three different areas that people might think of when they think of generate AI and security together. What we're gonna be focusing on though is generative AI for security. So like where can we use this as a security practitioner, as some cloud operations practitioner to further enhance what we're doing in this space. So let's discuss uh starting securely. So, uh, if you're familiar with uh Amazon Q developer, this is essentially a lot of folks will think about this as a development assistant tool either in an IDE, um. To help write code, help do unit tests, do a number of different things that you would do during the development life cycle, um, either in your IDE there's also a CLI functionality now where it can do a lot of cool agentic AI capabilities and actually do a lot of the different building and deploying for you. One thing to keep in mind is it's a powerful tool for security as well too, right? So if you're doing different security testing, you wanna look for different vulnerabilities we built some different, uh, some different demos around creating guard duty findings to test out end to end finding remediation, life cycles, looking for vulnerabilities across like an entire repo of code. And then getting like information on like how to fix those vulnerabilities as well to document and code for those things happen like this is still all thought of as a developer tool can be very very useful when it comes to security so keep that in mind. So lambda code scanning and Amazon Inspector is another area where you can see the generative AI capabilities. So if you're not too familiar, Amazon Inspector is our vulnerability management solution, native solution, uh, at AWS. It does a number of different things. It can scan EC2 instances, CICD plug-in capabilities. Uh, it also has a lambda scanning and that handle and that's done through a couple different ways so it can look at like packages being imported into lambda functions, but then also does the code scanning capabilities so looks at the code in lambda to look for like uh insecure cryptography or code injection types of uh vulnerabilities that might be introduced in code. And then now not only does like tells you where those things are but can give you recommendations on how to fix that right so if you're pushing these vulnerability findings down to the development teams that ultimately own these lambdas own this code, you're not only giving them the problem but helping them with the solution as well too. So management and governance. And AWS config, there's a capability called advanced query. Config records resources of of AWS resources or the state of those resources. So think of like. You've got an EC2 instance that has a security group where you change ingress rules in that security group. What did it look like before? What did it look like now? That's the state configuration of that security group and with config you can see it records those different states. So with advanced query you can essentially talk to this and say things like the example above, give me all my EBS volume, show the volume ID maybe you need to see. List all my lambda functions that are running no JS 16, right? You can simply ask that question, it'll give you the query that you need to go find that information in, uh, uh, the, the config resource recording. All right, so automating security operations. If you're not too familiar, Amazon guard duty extended threat detection is something that we launched at Reinvent last year. So if you're not too familiar with guard duty, it's our native threat detection service. Uh, we look at a uh, a number of different data sources VBC flow logs, cloud trail, Route 53 resolver logs. We also do runtime monitoring for system level events. Amazon extended threat detection is actually it's not a feature of guard duty it's something that we just launched it's a type of finding we call them attack sequence findings. If you think about guard duty before it could see something like, hey, there's a command and control activity happening from this EC2 instance or we see anonalous behavior happening from an IM roll. With extended threat detection we're bringing a number of these different pieces of the puzzle together to say here's an entire attack sequence from discovery to enumeration to exfiltration to some sort of impact mapping this to minor tactics, techniques and procedures and then bringing all of this together so you can see all the signals, all of the resources involved, and you're not having to, you know, respond to, hey, there's 10 or 15 guard duty findings together. And then, you know, putting them, um, you know, putting that that piece of the puzzle together. So right now we have a couple of different uh attack types attack sequence finding types, the first one being a credential compromise attack sequence type, and then the second one being a data compromise attack sequence type. So, um, you know, focused on probably the or not probably the, the two top, uh, kind of attack vectors as it comes to cloud environments. All right, so next is Amazon Detective summaries. So if you're not too familiar with Amazon Detective, it's uh a service where you can do different things like root cause analysis or investigations. It also consumes different logs like a cloud trail log or a VBC flow log, and there is a behavior graph behind the scenes, um, to understand resource relationships uh across across your AWS organization, so whether that's, you know, 1050, 500, 5000 accounts. Um, Think of guard duty attack sequence findings where you know it's bringing those findings together with detective you can kind of do that across uh you know any resource in your environment you could look up different roles, different EC2 instances, see what users are communicating with them, see other resource relationships to really understand what's going on across the accounts in your environment and your different resources. So for summaries, uh, it, it can essentially give you like the information associated with a number of different tactics or techniques that are seen in environments um and help you kind of truly understand some of the data that it's bringing back to you and this is really important especially from. Like if you have different analysts or operations folks that are using this tool, they're getting like a standard set of information it's not like one person perceiving it this way, another person perceiving it a different way, right, uh, keeping those things, uh, together. There All right, so next is security analytics. So this is one thing that I talk about quite often that probably my coworkers are tired of listening to me talk about, but. Security is often a data problem. There's lots of logs, there's lots of findings, there's lots of like you've got to make sense of all this information and then frankly. If you're working at an organization, which I'm sure most people here are, you've gotta sell your ideas you've gotta show progress on the work that you're doing. So if you wanna get funding for your next big idea, if you want to prove the, you know, your ability to execute on what you said you were gonna execute on data being super powerful, I personally, uh, am not good at this. So with Quicksite, um, there's essentially a Amazon Q plugin. Or not, it's not called a plug-in, it's just integration in Amazon Quick site. That gives the ability to do a number of different generative AI capabilities if you're not too familiar with Quick site, it's uh essentially a business intelligent tool. We have different, uh, Quick Start guides out there for like building security dashboards on Security lake and a number of different things as well there there too like to get started. Um, but you can use this, uh, this integration to do a number of different things in Quick site. So say for example you just want to build a visualization, right? You can say maybe you're feeding it cloud trail data, you're feeding it security of data VPC flow logs, something like that. You say, hey, what are my vulnerabilities for the last 30 days? I need a graph to show me my vulnerabilities for the last 30 days. What accounts have the most critical severity vulnerabilities, what resources have the most critical severity vulnerabilities. I need to visualize that, and it'll build you a graph that that does this. It also gives you the ability to tell a data story so it will build these pretty cool like data stories for you you essentially tell it to build a data story it's gonna take not only uh not only build like some some visualizations but also tell a story about this data. 90 days ago my your vulnerabilities were, you know, at an all time high and they started to trend down but in this other account they've actually gone up and they were associated with EKS clusters or something, right? Like it can give you some insights into the trends of your environment and understand, uh, a story you might wanna tell when you're using your data or if you're trying to, you know, prove your worth of uh what you've executed on maybe you could ask it to do that. And then finally just being able to like ask questions so like I see these dashboards, I see these numbers. You know, tell me more about this. Tell me about, uh, I have this KPI internally to reduce the mean time to respond. Tell me how long I've had security hub controls open. Tell me how long, you know, these other things like really anything you can think of, right? Just ask it questions look at month over month change, um. This is the uh quick site is something that I haven't never I've never really been that good at but this has been super helpful in like understanding that and really making sense of this data so if that is something you did not know about, I would, I would most certainly check that out. And then also Amazon Q developer and Amazon OpenSearch Service, so OpenSearch, a logging and analytics platform, uh, that was off of, uh, uh, Open search or, uh, open source elastic from years ago, um, but essentially this is sort of the same thing that we're just talking about in Q essentially you can ask it questions, get it to build dashboarding a lot of folks are using OpenSearch, so. This is something you should be taking advantage of in Open search if you're not already, but it can help you build things a little bit quicker. Say you have more junior analysts that are trying to do different things, right? This can help the learning curve when it comes to getting started and getting value out of the different services that you're using. All right. And then, uh, not only the, you know, AWS Native Services, but we wanted to make sure to talk about. Virtual security assistance as well too um definitely I know a lot of customers are building different assistants to look at log data or look at like cloud trail data. I saw a super cool demo the other day where they were using the Amazon QCLI to analyze like cloud trail data tell me where my errors are, tell me where you think I might have issues with permissioning or you know what, where could I cut down on some of this data, um. You know there's a lot of different examples online, frankly these days on ways to build different security assistance, but these are something that's, you know, readily available. You can bring in different data using rag-based models, uh, and build things that are pretty specific using Bedrock, uh, and then it's obviously got it's built in aging capabilities built in rag providers for Kindra and OpenSearch services like Vector Search as well too. So if you have not gone and looked at some of these you can actually get started pretty quick, right? I wouldn't be too intimidated with going and testing these things out um and one thing that's kind of a theme when it comes to generative AI and has been kind of the whole time that. Uh, since General Ba I came out a couple years ago, is folks should test, right? There should be, uh, you know, different sandboxes at organizations oftentimes as a security specialists I talked to organizations about sandboxing strategies and how do we give developers the ability to test things without. Um, you know, without giving them too much control, so you know, definitely something to think about, but until you test, until you understand how these things work, uh, you're never gonna be able to progress any further than that. So definitely, uh, dive in test use some of those, uh, use some of those different examples out there and, and, and get building for sure. OK. So 20 minutes goes by incredibly fast, um, but essentially just remember there's a lot of different native capabilities and we'll always continue to as AWS continues to iterate over time we'll continue to introduce different generative AI capabilities where it makes sense into our different services. One thing I would say being the the person who's normally looking for feedback to to advance our services is. Whoever your reps are at AWS and whoever you normally work with, give them your service feedback. Why, uh, why do we not have generative AI capabilities here or there and where would it, you know, help you provide security outcomes for you and your end customers? Uh, keep that in mind. Give us the feedback that you can. We would love to hear where we should go next. Hopefully this is giving you some information there, but keep these in mind. They're easy to start with inspector code remediations, detective findings. Uh, Que developer and, and, and Q in Quicksite Que developer, by the way, I believe is like $19 a month per user, so, uh, very, uh, cost effective to get started. So with that said, uh, wanna say thank you please fill out the survey. Hopefully this was helpful for everybody and if you have any other questions, I'll be around for a little while standing on the side, uh, uh, if anybody has any questions, so thanks.
