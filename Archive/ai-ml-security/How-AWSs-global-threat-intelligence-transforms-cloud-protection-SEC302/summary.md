## Summary
This session detailed AWS's internal threat intelligence capabilities and how they protect all customers automatically. Steven Goodman (Amazon Active Defense Program) and Tom Shull (VP Distinguished Engineer, Infrastructure) explained AWS's global threat detection systems including MAD PAT honeypots, network telemetry analysis, and proactive threat disruption. The presentation covered AWS's unique visibility into global threat patterns, real-world examples of threat actor disruption, and how internal security research translates into customer protection across all AWS services.

## Key Points
- - **MAD PAT Honeypot System**: Hierarchical honeypots across AWS regions capturing threat actor interactions and behaviors
- **Global Network Telemetry**: Comprehensive visibility into scanning patterns, exploitation attempts, and emerging threats
- **Automatic Customer Protection**: Threat intelligence automatically protects all customers without requiring opt-in
- **Threat Actor Disruption**: Proactive response to threat campaigns including infrastructure takedowns and attribution
- **Zero-Day Detection**: Early identification of new vulnerabilities through unusual port scanning and exploitation patterns
- **Geographic Threat Analysis**: Monitoring threat activity patterns by region, ASN, and network infrastructure
- **Broadband Router Compromises**: Detection of compromised consumer routers being used for large-scale scanning
- **Real-World Case Studies**: Detailed examples of threat intelligence leading to customer protection and internet-wide security improvements
- **Cross-Service Integration**: Threat intelligence feeds into AWS security services for enhanced detection and prevention
- **Continuous Monitoring**: 24/7 analysis of threat landscapes with real-time response capabilities

## Technical Details
- - **MAD PAT Architecture**: EC2-based honeypots running vulnerable services across multiple AWS regions with hierarchical interaction logging
- **Scanning Analysis**: Detection of port-specific scanning patterns indicating CVE exploitation or zero-day activity
- **Network Infrastructure Correlation**: Analysis of ASN-based scanning patterns revealing compromised infrastructure
- **Exploitation Telemetry**: High-interactivity logging capturing full attack chains and payload analysis
- **Threat Intelligence Pipeline**: Automated processing of honeypot data feeding into AWS security service detections
- **Geographic Correlation**: Regional threat pattern analysis identifying targeted campaigns and infrastructure compromises
- **Disruption Methodologies**: Coordinated response including infrastructure notifications, ISP engagement, and law enforcement cooperation
- **Service Integration**: Threat intelligence feeds GuardDuty, WAF, Shield, and other AWS security services
- **Real-Time Processing**: Stream processing of network telemetry for immediate threat detection and response
- **Attribution Techniques**: Advanced analysis linking threat actors to infrastructure, tactics, and campaign patterns

>> ALL RIGHT. HOWDY, EVERYBODY.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING TO SEE OUR PRESENTATION. I'M STEVEN
GOODMAN. I'M A LEADER IN OUR AMAZON ACTIVE DEFENSE PROGRAM.
SUPER EAGER TO CHAT WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT HOW WE CREATE AND
APPLY THREAT INTELLIGENCE AND HOW THAT CREATES CONTINUOUS
PROTECTION IN THE CLOUD FOR EVERY CUSTOMER, AUTOMATICALLY.
AWESOME. YEAH. >> HI. MY NAME IS TOM SHULL. I'M
A VICE PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE
ORGANIZATION. AND OVER THERE I FOCUS ON OUR GLOBAL NETWORK
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS DDOS DEFENSE AND THREAT DECEPTION
TECHNOLOGIES. >> AWESOME. ALL RIGHT, SO JUST A
QUICK SHOW OF HANDS AROUND THE ROOM. WHO HERE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN
ON THE FRONT LINES OF RESPONDING TO REAL WORLD THREAT ACTIVITY IN
YOUR ENVIRONMENT? OKAY. AWESOME. ALL RIGHT. GREAT. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO FOR YOUR USERS, YOUR
ORGANIZATION. YOU'RE REALLY THE REASON WHY WE INVEST IN
EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY, FROM
ANALYSIS TO TECHNOLOGY TO MITIGATIONS. SO WE'VE GOT THREE
BIG THEMES THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH TODAY. FIRST, WHAT
WE'RE SEEING INSIDE AWS, THE VISIBILITY AND TELEMETRY THAT WE
HAVE TO MONITOR OUR NETWORKS AND AGAIN PROTECT EVERY CUSTOMER.
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE SEE OUTSIDE ON THE
BROADER INTERNET, THE THREAT ACTIVITY THAT WE SEE AND RESPOND
TO TODAY. AND THEN THE THIRD IS WHERE DO THOSE TWO THINGS MEET?
SOME DEEP DIVE EXAMPLES ON ACTUAL SCENARIOS WHERE WE'VE
USED OUR THREAT INTELLIGENCE TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND EVEN SHAPE
THE BROADER INTERNET ENVIRONMENT. SO WE'LL START WITH
SOME OF THE SENSORS AND VISIBILITY THAT AWS USES TO
PROTECT AGAINST THREAT ACTIVITY. BIG CAVEAT THESE ARE INTERNAL
AWS PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY. THEY ARE NOT AWS
PUBLIC SERVICES THAT YOU CAN BUY AND USE TODAY. THOUGH MUCH OF
WHAT WE'VE BUILT HERE DOES, IN FACT BUILD ON TOP OF THE PUBLIC
SERVICES THAT YOU KNOW AND LOVE TODAY EC2, S3, ETC. SO I'M GOING
TO TURN IT OVER TO TOM. AS A VETERAN NETWORK ENGINEER TO WALK
US THROUGH SOME OF THE NETWORK TELEMETRY THAT POWERS OUR THREAT
INTEL WORK TODAY. >> ALL RIGHT. SO ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT WE BUILT SEVERAL YEARS AGO IS MAD PAT, AND IT'S
BASICALLY OUR HONEYPOT SYSTEM THAT EXISTS ACROSS AWS REGIONS
AND RUNS ON EC2 INSTANCES. AND IT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY
VULNERABLE SERVER. IT RUNS A VARIETY OF SERVICES ON IT. IT'S
A HIERARCHICAL HONEYPOT, AND ONE OF THE THINGS IT DOES IS IT
CAPTURES THOSE SORTS OF INTERACTIONS FROM CLIENTS ON THE
INTERNET CONNECTING TO IT. IT LOGS WHAT KIND OF INTERACTIONS
IT HAS, AND IT DOES ANALYSIS ON IT. AND WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE
THAT DATA AND WE USE IT IN VARIOUS WAYS FROM A DETECTION
PERSPECTIVE, AND WE FEED THAT INTO OTHER AWS SECURITY RELATED
PRODUCTS TO FOR FROM A DEFENSE PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS WE USE
THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT FROM IT FOR ANY SORT OF THREAT ACTOR
DISRUPTION WORK. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT MAD PAT, THIS HONEYPOT
THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE, THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KIND OF
WAYS TO INTERACT WITH IT. AND YOU THINK KIND OF ONE BASIC ONE
IS, WELL, WHAT ABOUT JUST SCANNING ACTIVITY. SO THAT COULD
JUST BE THINGS FROM PING SWEEPS, THINGS LIKE THAT ALL THE WAY TO,
LET'S SAY, SCANNING FOR A PARTICULAR PORT NUMBER. AND THIS
IS WHERE IT ACTUALLY GETS A LITTLE BIT INTERESTING BECAUSE
IF YOU THINK ABOUT, WELL, LET'S SAY ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SEE A
PARTICULAR DESTINATION PORT GETTING SCANNED HEAVILY ON OUR
NETWORK. WELL, THAT KIND OF SOUNDS VERY INTERESTING. WELL,
WHY IS SOMEBODY SCANNING THAT PORT? WHAT PARTICULAR SERVICE
EXISTS ON THAT PORT? IS THERE A KNOWN CVE? IS IT SOMETHING NEW?
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO KIND OF PULL THE
THREAD AT TO ACTUALLY KIND OF FIGURE OUT, WELL, WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE AND WHY IS THERE A CERTAIN INTEREST ON A PARTICULAR
PORT. AND THAT COULD BRING US TO SOMETHING THAT COULD BE
POTENTIAL ZERO DAY OR SOMETHING ELSE? THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT
WE SEE TOO. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE SEE SCANNING ACTIVITY THAT COMES
FROM A VERY SPECIFIC PART OF THE WORLD, OR SPECIFIC ASN OR A
CERTAIN SET OF NETWORKS, FOR EXAMPLE, WE ONCE SAW A
PARTICULAR BROADBAND NETWORKS ALL OF A SUDDEN START SCANNING
VERY HEAVILY, AND WE'RE LIKE, WELL, WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
ABOUT THAT? LIKE, COULD IT BE THAT THAT PARTICULAR BROADBAND
NETWORK DEPLOYS A CERTAIN TYPE OF ROUTER IN THEIR NETWORK, AND
IT HAS BEEN COMPROMISED AND IT'S BEING USED FOR SCANNING. SO IT
DOES ACTUALLY HAVE INSIGHTS JUST IN THE SCANNING TELEMETRY ON ITS
OWN. ANOTHER ONE IS SCANNING AND EXPLOITATION TYPE BEHAVIOR. AND
THIS IS WHERE REALLY IT'S HIGH LEVEL OF INTERACTIVITY. AND IT'S
LOGGING VISIBILITY REALLY HELPS BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE
WHAT ARE PEOPLE SCANNING AND ATTEMPTING TO EXPLOIT. IS THIS A
KNOWN CVE. IS IT SOMETHING POTENTIALLY A ZERO DAY SOMETHING
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. BUT GETTING THAT KIND OF RICH DATA
OF ACTUALLY WHAT ARE PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO SEND AT IT AND
INTERACT WITH IT FROM A REQUEST QUERY PERSPECTIVE GIVES US THAT
LEVEL OF INSIGHT. AND FINALLY, MAD POD COULD GO A LITTLE BIT
FURTHER, RIGHT? IT CAN ACTUALLY NOT JUST, YOU KNOW, GET THESE
SCANNING REQUESTS THAT MAY COME IN OR EXPLOITATION ATTEMPTS, BUT
AS PART OF ITS HIGH INTERACTIVITY, IT CAN ACTUALLY
GO AND SAY, OKAY, SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET ME TO
DOWNLOAD THIS MALWARE. I'LL ACTUALLY GO AND DOWNLOAD IT, AND
I CAN DETONATE IT AND DO THE ANALYSIS OF IT. AND SO IT CAN
ACTUALLY HAVE THAT LEVEL OF TAKING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO
REALLY SEE WHAT IS SOMEONE TRYING TO GET THE HONEYPOT TO
DO. SO INTERESTING AREA. SO WE'VE HAD MAD PAT FOR SEVERAL
YEARS, AND WE'VE ONLY TALKED ABOUT IT PUBLICLY IN THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF OR SO. BUT A FEW YEARS AGO WE DECIDED TO PIVOT
AND ACTUALLY LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF DDOS. AND SO MAD PAT HAS SOME
INTERESTING APPLICATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THE DDOS AREA, WHICH IS
AN AREA I PARTICULARLY FOCUS IN. AND WHEN YOU KIND OF LOOK AT
DDOS, THERE'S REALLY KIND OF THREE PILLARS. THERE'S KIND OF
THREE DIFFERENT INFRASTRUCTURE WAYS DDOS REALLY OCCURS. AND THE
FIRST ONE IS A COMMON ONE IS BOTNETS. AND SO IN THE CASE OF A
BOTNET IT NEEDS TO PROPAGATE, IT NEEDS TO SCAN, IT NEEDS TO
SPREAD. AND SO IN THIS CASE MATTERPORT WILL RECEIVE THESE
SCANNING AND EXPLOITATION ATTEMPTS. IT'LL GO AND GET THE
MALWARE WHEREVER IT WAS INSTRUCTED TO DOWNLOAD IT. IT'LL
DETONATE IT, IT'LL ANALYZE THE MALWARE AND SAY, OKAY, HERE'S A
COMMAND AND CONTROL SERVER. SINCE BOTNETS ARE TYPICALLY
DRIVEN BY THESE, IT CAN IDENTIFY THE COMMAND AND CONTROL SERVER.
IF IT'S A DNS NAME, ITS IP ADDRESS, ITS PORT, AND THEN IT
CAN THEN ACTUALLY CONNECT TO IT AND SIMULATE THAT IT'S BASICALLY
A BOTNET CLIENT AND ACTUALLY EXTRACT THAT TELEMETRY OF BOTNET
ATTACK SIGNALS GOING THROUGH IT, AND THEN ACTUALLY GO A LITTLE
BIT FURTHER TO SAY, WELL, IF THIS IS A KNOWN BOTNET, WE
VERIFIED IT, WE CAN FINGERPRINT ITS C2 PROTOCOL. WE CAN THEN
GENERATE AN ABUSE REPORT TO WHEREVER IT'S HOSTED IN THE
WORLD, WHETHER THE DOMAIN REGISTER, AS WELL AS THE IP
ADDRESS, WHEREVER IT'S PARTICULARLY HOSTED ON AN ASN OR
HOSTING PROVIDER. ANOTHER PART WITH DDOS IS LAYER SEVEN
ATTACKS, AND SO COMMONLY WITH LAYER SEVEN ATTACKS, ALSO KNOWN
AS HTTP REQUEST FLOODS OR APPLICATION FLOODS. THE WAY THAT
THEY'RE TYPICALLY ARCHITECTED IS THAT THEY WILL GO AND HAVE
MULTIPLE MACHINES THAT USE PROXIES. AND WHAT WE MEAN BY
THAT IS LIKE MISCONFIGURED SQUID OPEN PROXIES ON THE INTERNET.
AND THAT'S WHEN IF YOU EVER SEE ON THE TARGET SIDE OF A DDOS
ATTACK FOR LAYER SEVEN, YOU'RE TYPICALLY BEING HIT BY
INDIVIDUAL OPEN PROXIES GENERALLY AND SOMETIMES PRIVATE
PROXIES AS WELL. BUT IN THIS CASE, MATPAT CAN SIMULATE THAT
IT'S AN OPEN PROXY, AND IT COULD GET ON THE LIST THAT ACTORS USED
AND SHARE AROUND. AND BASICALLY THEY'LL END UP USING MAD POD AS
AN OPEN PROXY, AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT IS BEING
TARGETED. WE CAN IDENTIFY THE TARGET, AND WE CAN SEE THE
ACTUAL TRUE SOURCE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GENERATING THE ATTACK
IN THIS CASE. AND THEN WE CAN GO AND ENGAGE WITH THAT PARTICULAR
ISP. THAT'S ACTUALLY THE REAL TRUE SOURCE OF THAT LAYER SEVEN
ATTACK. AND WE AUTOMATE THAT WORKFLOW TO GENERATE THOSE ABUSE
REPORTS OUTBOUND. FINALLY, THERE'S KIND OF A CLASSIC ATTACK
METHOD WHICH IS WITH SOURCE IP SPOOFING. AND THIS COULD EITHER
BE SOURCE IP DIRECT FLOODS OR THE SOURCE IP SPOOFED TO
SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN THE TRUE ORIGIN IP OR AMPLIFICATION
REFLECTION ATTACKS. AND IN THIS CASE, MAD PAT CAN ACT LIKE AN
AMPLIFIER REFLECTOR, OR IT COULD BE RUNNING TRADITIONALLY AND
ALLOW THESE TYPES OF ATTACKS. YOU WILL SEE OPEN DNS SERVERS,
MISCONFIGURED NTP CHARGEN MEMCACHED. SO IT COULD BE
RUNNING THESE SORTS OF SERVICES ON MAD PAT, AND IT'LL GET ON
THESE AMPLIFIER REFLECTOR LISTS. AND THEN WE CAN SEE THAT TRAFFIC
COME INTO OUR NETWORK AND ACTUALLY SEE WELL WHERE IN OUR
GLOBAL NETWORK, AS WE DO RUN A LARGE NETWORK, OVER 5000 UNIQUE
ASNS WE PAIR WITH GLOBALLY, WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHERE THE
SPOOFED TRAFFIC IS COMING IN FROM A ROUTER AND INTERFACE
PERSPECTIVE AND THEN ENGAGE THAT PARTICULAR NETWORK. ANOTHER
SOURCE OF TELEMETRY IS FROM OUR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF.
AS I MENTIONED, WE HAVE A VERY LARGE NETWORK THAT SPANS THE
GLOBE. OUR ROUTERS THEMSELVES GENERATE AND EMIT THEIR OWN KIND
OF TELEMETRY. AND SO THAT COULD BE NETFLOW OR SLO RECORDS THAT
COME OUT OF A ROUTER. AND TYPICALLY THAT'S SAMPLED ONE OUT
OF EVERY N AMOUNT OF PACKETS. WE SEND OUT ONE OF THESE RECORDS
AND THAT KIND OF METADATA THAT GETS SHARED HERE INCLUDES THINGS
LIKE THE ROUTER IDENTIFIER. SO WE KNOW WHICH ONE SOURCE AND
DESTINATION PHYSICAL INTERFACE, WHICH IS REALLY USEFUL TO KNOW
WHICH PARTICULAR NETWORK YOU'RE CONNECTED TO. AND YOU SAW IT
FROM THEM IN SOME CASES. ALSO, IF WE'RE AT AN INTERNET
EXCHANGE, WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THE SOURCE MAC ADDRESS SO WE CAN
KNOW EXACTLY WHICH PARTICULAR PAIR OR PARTICIPANT ON THE
EXCHANGE SENT IT. SOURCE AND DESTINATION, IP PROTOCOL SOURCE
AND DESTINATION PORT, AND THEN SOME AMOUNT OF PACKETS OR BYTES
COUNTER. AND SO THAT'S REALLY USEFUL FOR US TO REALLY NOT ONLY
JUST OPERATE AND MANAGE OUR NETWORK RIGHT AND DO SIMPLE
TRAFFIC ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES, BUT IT'S REALLY
USEFUL FOR ACTUALLY SEEING SOME OF THE PATTERNS OF CERTAIN SORT
OF ABUSIVE AND SCANNING BEHAVIOR. AND SO AN EXAMPLE WITH
THAT OF THAT MIGHT BE ONE TO MANY. RIGHT? SO IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR HEAVY SCANNING ACTIVITY, YOU'LL SEE THAT ONE
SINGLE SOURCE IP TALKING TO LOTS OF DESTINATION IPS, PARTICULARLY
WITH MAYBE A SPECIFIC PORT AS WELL. YOU CAN ALSO USE IT FOR
AMPLIFICATION REFLECTION TYPE ATTACK DETECTIONS. CERTAINLY
WHEN IT'S ONE SOURCE IP OR IN SOME CASES WE SEE SOME PEOPLE
WHO WILL ACTUALLY SPOOF ENTIRE SLASH 20 FOURS AT A TIME TO
BASICALLY CREATE THIS KIND OF SCATTERING EFFECT OF ATTACK
TRAFFIC. AND THEN FINALLY, THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION IS
INTERESTING TOO, BECAUSE WE DO RUN THIS GLOBAL NETWORK AND WE
DO CONNECT TO SO MANY NETWORKS DIRECTLY, WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE
AND LOOK AND SAY, WOW, THIS PARTICULAR PORT FROM A SPECIFIC
PAIR, WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF TRAFFIC COMING THROUGH IT. WHAT
WHAT IT COULD BE SOMETHING ANOMALOUS. IT COULD BE SOMETHING
INTERESTING. WE COULD ZOOM IN ON IT AND ACTUALLY SAY, WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR NETWORK IN THIS LOCATION THAT WE'RE SEEING
INCREASING OUR NETWORK? ANOTHER PART, TOO IS, WELL, WE EXPECT TO
BE CONNECTED TO FROM DIFFERENT CLIENTS OVER THE INTERNET. WHAT
HAPPENS IF SOMETHING FROM EC2 CONNECTS TO IT? IT COULD BE
POTENTIALLY ACCIDENTAL, BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING MALICIOUS, WE
ACTUALLY AUTOMATE A WORKFLOW WHERE IF WE SEE THAT SORT OF
CONNECTIVITY AND NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR FROM AN EC2 INSTANCE,
WE ACTUALLY AUTOMATE A WORKFLOW WITH OUR TRUST AND SAFETY TEAM,
WHERE WE GO AND REACH OUT WITH THE CUSTOMER AND TAKE ANY SORT
OF MITIGATING ACTIONS AS REQUIRED. SO ANOTHER PART TWO
THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING IS WE DO HAVE A LOT OF IPV4 AND IPV6
ADDRESS SPACE, BUT NOT ALL OF OUR IP ADDRESSES ARE ACTUALLY
ALLOCATED TO CUSTOMERS OR SERVICE. THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN
ALLOCATED YET. AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THAT TRAFFIC, YOU CAN SEE TRAFFIC GOING TO CERTAINLY
WHAT'S ALLOCATED. BUT WHAT ABOUT TRAFFIC THAT'S GOING TO THINGS
THAT'S NOT ALLOCATED. WHY ARE THEY TALKING TO IPS THAT THERE'S
NO SERVICE BEHIND THEM. AND SO THAT KIND OF RAISES AN
INTERESTING QUESTION. I'LL HAND IT OVER HERE. BACK TO STEVEN TO
TALK ABOUT THAT A BIT MORE DETAIL. YEAH.
>> SO WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME REALLY COOL ANALYSIS,
SPECIFICALLY ON TRAFFIC THAT INTERACTS WITH BOTH MAD POT AND
OUR UNALLOCATED IP SPACE. AND SO WHEN WE COMPARE THESE TWO DATA
SETS, THE COMPARISON ITSELF GIVES US A WHOLE NEW LENS OF
INTELLIGENCE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CIRCLE ON THE LEFT, THE BLUE
CIRCLE THAT IS ALL THE TRAFFIC, THE PERCENTAGE OF TRAFFIC THAT
WE SEE INTERACTING WITH MAD POT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS IN THE
PINK CIRCLE IS EVERYTHING THAT WE SEE INTERACTING WITH OUR
UNALLOCATED IP SPACE. AND SO YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S A BIG
OVERLAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS. AND SO THAT'S ABOUT 21%
OF WHAT WE SEE COMING INTO OUR NETWORK HITTING THESE SOURCES.
AND WITHIN THAT YOU SEE A LARGE YELLOW CIRCLE OF EXPLOITATION
ATTEMPTS THAT ARE COMING FROM THOSE SOURCES TALKING TO BOTH OF
OUR SENSORS. AND SO I WANT TO BE SUPER CLEAR, THESE 5%, THESE ARE
EXPLOITATION ATTEMPTS. THIS IS NOT PORT KNOCKING OR PROBING OR
SOME SORT OF NEUTRAL MAPPING ACTIVITY, ACTUAL ATTACKS. WHEN
WE LOOK AT JUST THE INTERACTIONS WITH OUR UNALLOCATED SPACE, WE
ALSO SEE ABOUT 80% OF THOSE SOURCES HAVE ABUSE REPORTS
SUBMITTED AGAINST THEM TO VARIOUS THIRD PARTY SERVICES. SO
WHEN WE PUT ALL OF THESE FACTS TOGETHER, THAT A SOURCE IS
COMMUNICATING WITH MAD POT, THAT IS COMMUNICATING WITH OUR
UNALLOCATED IP SPACE AND IT HAS ABUSE REPORTS, WE ACTUALLY CAN
PREVENTATIVELY PROTECT CUSTOMERS BY REJECTING TRAFFIC FROM THESE
SOURCES BEFORE ANY PAYLOAD EVER ACTUALLY MAKES ITS WAY TO AN AWS
CUSTOMER. AND SO COMBINING SENSOR DATA IN THIS WAY, WE
ACTUALLY CREATE INTELLIGENCE FOR BOTH REACTIVE DETECTION AS WELL
AS PROACTIVE PREVENTION. OKAY. SO WE'VE TALKED THROUGH A
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SENSORS THAT WE HAVE AND THE WAY THAT WE
CAN COMBINE THEM. WE'VE GOT THESE MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES. SO
WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY SEEING OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET OUTSIDE OF
OUR NETWORK FROM THREAT ACTORS. THE TOP TECHNIQUE FAR AND AWAY
IS MASS VULNERABILITY SCANNING. THIS IS REALLY WHERE THREAT
ACTORS ARE GOING ACROSS BROAD RANGES OF IP ADDRESS SPACE,
LOOKING TO MONETIZE OR COVERTLY CONTROL VULNERABLE RESOURCES
THAT THEY DISCOVER. SO THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AS
NETWORK BANDWIDTH DATA CENTERS HAVE GROWN. AND REALLY, AS
THERE'S BEEN DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIALIZED HIGH SPEED SCANNING
SOFTWARE LIKE ZMAP AND MASS SCAN. SO WE CONSISTENTLY SEE
ABOUT 15 TO 20,000 EXTERNAL IP ADDRESSES ATTEMPTING TO EXPLOIT
VULNERABILITIES ACROSS THE GLOBAL AWS NETWORK. THIS IS A
REALLY DYNAMIC SET. ABOUT 12% OF THE IPS THAT WE'RE SEEING ARE
TURNING OVER EVERY THREE MINUTES. SO THINKING ABOUT THAT
DYNAMISM AND WHAT IS THE ACTUAL DRIVER OF THE THREAT ACTIVITY?
IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT TO GET A DAILY THREAT INTELLIGENCE DUMP
OR EVEN AN HOURLY THREAT INTELLIGENCE DUMP. WE WANT TO GO
FASTER TO BE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING OCCURRING
OUT ON THE INTERNET. SO AT THE SAME TIME, WE DO TEND TO SEE
CLUSTERING ACROSS ASNS AND PARTICULAR CIDR BLOCKS OF AROUND
THE SLASH 24 SIZE. AND WHEN WE SEE THESE PATTERNS, THAT'S A
REALLY GOOD INDICATOR. HEY THERE'S ACTUALLY THREAT
CONTROLLED INFRASTRUCTURE AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME
THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO HONE IN ON. SO WE ALSO SEE NETWORK
DEVICES FROM A VARIETY OF VENDORS VERY HIGHLY TARGETED.
THIS WILL BE EVERYTHING FROM REMOTE CODE EXECUTION CVES TO
DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS TO EVEN CREDENTIAL STUFFING, TRYING
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DEFAULT CREDENTIALS OR CREDENTIAL LEAKS
TO TAKE OVER THE DEVICES THAT ACTUALLY MANAGE NETWORK TRAFFIC
THEMSELVES. SPEAKING OF CREDENTIAL STUFFING, THAT IS
ALSO A THREAT TECHNIQUE THAT IS ALIVE AND WELL. EVEN WITH MFA
AND PASSKEYS BECOMING MORE POPULAR FOR INDIVIDUAL USERS, WE
SEE A LOT OF SSH AND RDP CREDENTIAL STUFFING THREAT
ACTORS ATTEMPTING TO TAKE OVER THESE CORE REMOTE ADMINISTRATION
SERVICES AND GET ACCESS TO HOSTS. AND THEN IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT ZERO DAYS. SOMETIMES IT'S ABOUT THE THOUSAND DAYS OR
SOMETIMES EVEN LONGER. WE SEE CVES FROM THAT WERE DISCLOSED IN
2009, OVER 15 YEARS AGO, STILL ACTIVELY BEING ATTEMPTED AGAINST
OUR MAD POT HONEYPOTS. SO FOR PROTECTION AND THE CUSTOMER
CONTROLLED SPACE PATCHING MFA ZERO TRUST NETWORK
ARCHITECTURES, THOSE REMAIN KEY PRACTICES. SO I'M GOING TO TURN
IT OVER TO TOM TO ACTUALLY GO DEEP ON AN EXAMPLE OF HOW
QUICKLY THREAT ACTORS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GOING AFTER NEWLY
DISCLOSED VULNERABILITIES. >> SO WALK YOU THROUGH A
PARTICULAR THING THAT HAPPENED BACK IN OCTOBER 2024. AND BACK
THEN THERE WAS A PARTICULAR WEB HOSTING CONTROL PANEL THAT WAS
OUT THERE AND IT LIVED ON BY DEFAULT, LIVED ON A VERY
SPECIFIC TCP PORT. AND SO RIGHT AROUND OCTOBER 23RD, THERE WAS
AN RHCE THAT WAS REPORTED REGARDING THIS PARTICULAR PIECE
OF SOFTWARE. SO YOU COULD REMOTELY BASICALLY GET ROOT ON
WHATEVER THING WAS RUNNING THIS. AND SO THAT CAME OUT. AND WITHIN
A FEW DAYS AND OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME, THERE WAS A NUMBER OF
SCANNING ACTIVITY THAT WE PICKED UP ON THE PORT SIDE, LOOKING AT
THIS PARTICULAR PORT AND TRYING TO INTERACT WITH IT AND
EXPLOITATION BEHAVIOR. BUT WHAT WAS REALLY KIND OF NOTABLE WAS
THAT ON OCTOBER 28TH, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A FIVE
TERABYTE BOTNET DDOS ATTACK THAT OCCURRED. AND SO THAT GOT OUR
ATTENTION TO SAY, WOW, WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? AND SO
DIVING INTO THAT AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SOURCES OF THIS
BOTNET ATTACK, WHICH IS AND THE REASON WHY THAT'S KIND OF
NOTABLE IS THAT TYPICALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF BOTNETS, THERE'S
KIND OF A WIDE SPECTRUM OF ON THE LOW END, IT'S IN THE TENS OF
GIGABITS PER SECOND, AND THE MEDIUM END, IT'S SOMEWHERE
AROUND THE MIDDLE, RIGHT AROUND MAYBE 100 GIGS, MAYBE SEVERAL
HUNDRED GIGABITS PER SECOND. AND THEN MAYBE A FEW TIMES A YEAR,
LIKE A BOTNET WILL EVENTUALLY GET TO LIKE THE SINGLE LOW
TERABITS PER SECOND RANGE. SO TO SEE SOMETHING THAT ALL OF A
SUDDEN CAME IN WITH FIVE T WAS KIND OF INTERESTING. THAT KIND
OF LINED UP WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS PARTICULAR
VULNERABILITY THAT WAS REPORTED OUT THERE. AND WHAT WAS
INTERESTING WAS TYPICALLY WITH A LOT OF BOTNETS, IT'S USUALLY IOT
RESIDENTIAL DVR TYPE DEVICES, BUT IN THIS CASE THIS IS
PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF DEDICATED HOSTS AND VMS THAT WERE
CONTRIBUTING TO IT BECAUSE THEY WERE RUNNING WEB SERVERS AND HAD
THIS WEB SERVER WEB CONTROL PANEL ON THEM. AND SO WE SAW
THAT WE SAW THAT A PRETTY LARGE ATTACK. AND IT REALLY KIND OF
RAISED SOME QUESTIONS AS TO LIKE, HEY, THIS THING GOES
PUBLIC, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO JUMP ON IT. AND IT'S NOT JUST, YOU
KNOW, THE DDOS FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO BUILD A BOTNET THERE.
BUT WE ALSO SAW THIS LEVERAGE BY FOLKS TRYING TO DO CRYPTO MINING
AND JUST GENERALIZED SSH KIND OF BACKDOORING. AND SO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA, KIND OF WHAT MATPAT SAW IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME. HERE'S ONE
EXAMPLE WHERE DDOS MALWARE IS TRYING TO BE EXPLOITED WHEN THIS
IS ACTUAL CAPTURE OF A MAD PAD INTERACTION, WHERE YOU CAN SEE
IT TRYING TO BASICALLY DOWNLOAD A SHELL SCRIPT, EXECUTE THAT
SHELL SCRIPT. IF YOU EXECUTE THAT SHELL SCRIPT, IT'LL
DOWNLOAD SOME BINARIES, IT'LL TRY TO EXECUTE IT. AND THAT'S
THE ACTUAL DDOS MALWARE BOTNET SOFTWARE. ANOTHER ONE, CRYPTO
MINING. WHENEVER YOU SEE XMRIG, IT'S USUALLY KIND OF A DEAD
GIVEAWAY. WHAT'S IT UP TO? SO THAT WAS PROPAGATING AS WELL. WE
ALSO SAW CASES WHERE SSH KEYS SO AUTHORIZED KEYS BEING UPDATED SO
SOMEBODY CAN GET INTO IT. AND LOOKING ON THE FORUMS ONLINE OF
PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND OF GOING THROUGH THIS AND WERE IMPACTED
BY IT EXTERNALLY, IT WAS INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE WERE
FINDING MACHINES WHERE IT HAD, YOU KNOW, DDOS, CRYPTO MINING,
AND THEY WERE BACKDOORED AS WELL BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL KIND OF
TRIPPING OVER EACH OTHER, ALL THESE DIFFERENT ACTORS TRYING TO
SCAN FOR IT. I THINK ANOTHER ASPECT, TOO, IS HERE'S WHAT WE
SAW FROM OUR THIS KIND OF AN EXCERPT OF OUR MAD POT BOTNET,
C2 TAPPING INFRASTRUCTURE, WHERE BASICALLY SHOWS HERE'S THE C2 IP
ADDRESS, HERE'S THE PARTICULAR TCP PORT THAT'S TCP PORT THAT
IT'S LIVING ON. HERE'S THE BOTNET C2 TYPE BASED UPON
FINGERPRINTING THE ACTUAL PROTOCOL. IN THIS CASE IT WAS
MOO BOT THAT GENERATED THAT ATTACK AND THE TARGET ADDRESS
AND GIVES US KIND OF A TIMESTAMP. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF
WHAT WE SEE ON OUR END WHEN WE ACTUALLY KIND OF LOOK AT THE C2
FEEDS GOING OUT. BUT I THINK WHAT'S KIND OF REALLY COOL ABOUT
THIS IS IF YOU KIND OF START WITH THIS VULNERABILITY GOING
PUBLIC, PEOPLE START SCANNING AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH
MATPAT IS WE SEE THAT INITIAL SCAN, THAT ONE TCP SESSION,
RIGHT, WITH THE HTTP REQUEST THAT GOES THROUGH THERE. WE
COLLECT THAT DATA. AND THEN THE NEXT PART IS ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, A
SYSTEM CALLED SONORUS IS WE CAN DETECT THAT SORT OF MASS
SCANNING, AND WE CAN ACTUALLY BLOCK THAT MASS SCANNING
BEHAVIOR WHEN IT'S GOING ACROSS A WIDE SET OF ADDRESSES IN OUR
NETWORK. SO THAT PROTECTS CUSTOMERS FROM ANY FURTHER
SCANNING FROM THOSE PARTICULAR RESOURCES. THE NEXT THING THAT
WE DO IS, WELL, WE'VE TAKEN THIS BOTNET MALWARE, WE'VE DETONATED
IT. WE KNOW WHO THE C2 IS. DO WE WANT ANYONE FROM AWS, EC2 TO BE
ABLE TO KIND OF BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THAT C2? PROBABLY
NOT. WE ACTUALLY IMPAIR AND PREVENT THAT CONNECTIVITY FROM
OCCURRING. SO IF THERE WAS ANY KIND OF INFECTION OR INFECTION,
IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTACT THAT C2 AND ACTUALLY GET ANY
SORT OF ATTACK COMMANDS AS WELL AS IF WE DO SEE A CUSTOMER
ACTUALLY TRYING TO TALK TO THAT C2, OUR TRUST AND SAFETY TEAM
REACHES OUT TO THEM TO NOTIFY THEM THAT, HEY, YOU NEED TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS. AND FINALLY WE ACTUALLY GO AND FOR THIS IS
REALLY FOR THE GOOD OF THE INTERNET AS A WHOLE, WHERE WE
ACTUALLY GO AND REACH OUT TO THE HOSTING PROVIDER WHERE THAT C2
IS LOCATED, AND ANY DNS DOMAIN NAME THAT COULD BE ASSOCIATED
WITH THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WITH AN ABUSE REPORT. SO I THINK IT'S
PRETTY COOL THAT THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL CONNECTION, THAT ONE
EXPLOITATION ATTEMPT, TRIGGERS ALL THESE OTHER OPERATIONS
AUTOMATICALLY BEHIND THE SCENES. SO WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT KIND OF MALICIOUS VULNERABILITY SCANNING IN DEPTH.
AND BUT YOU KNOW WE DID TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DDOS PART.
AND SO KIND OF GIVING THE IDEA OF LIKE WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN
THE THREAT LANDSCAPE, SINCE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME
OF THESE TOPICS, KIND OF GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON WHERE
DDOS IS. IF YOU LOOK BACK TOWARDS LIKE THE 1990S TO INTO
THE 2000 SPOOFED TYPE OF SOURCE, IP ATTACKS WERE REALLY COMMON.
THAT COULD EITHER BE A DIRECT SPOOFED FLOOD WHERE THE SOURCE
IPS ARE RANDOMIZED AND IT'S MAYBE A SYN FLOOD, BUT ONE OF
THE MORE COMMON ONES IS UDP AMPLIFICATION AND REFLECTION,
WHERE IT'S BASICALLY THE SOURCE IP WHO'S LAUNCHING THE ATTACK
SPOOFED THE SOURCE IP OF THE ACTUAL TARGET, SENDS IT TO
AMPLIFIERS AND REFLECTORS, AND THEN SENDS A LARGER AMOUNT OF
TRAFFIC TO THE TARGET. AND THAT WAS REALLY POPULAR IN THE LATE
90S INTO THE 2000. AROUND THE 20 TENS, THINGS KIND OF CHANGED UP
A BIT. FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S THE RISE OF BOOTER OR STRESSER
SERVICES, WHERE YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO LEARN HOW TO
LAUNCH A DDOS. YOU CAN PAY SOMEBODY ELSE WHO HAS A
STOREFRONT WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT AND PAY IN CRYPTO AND THINGS
LIKE THAT, WHERE YOU CAN THEN SPECIFY YOUR TARGET. YOU HAVE A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ALLOCATED TO YOU. SO THE RISE OF
THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES AS WELL AS BOTNETS. SO MARIAH FORGET
LATER ON MOOBOT AND A VARIETY OF OTHER VARIANTS COME ABOUT. AND
THOSE PARTICULARLY TARGET IOT TYPE DEVICES TO LAUNCH THESE
ATTACKS. AND THAT REALLY GETS POPULAR IN THE 20 TENS. AND THE
LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A, I WOULD SAY A
GROWTH OF LAYER SEVEN AND APPLICATION AND HTTP REQUEST
FLOODS. AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHERE IT'S A DIFFERENT STYLE OF
ATTACK. YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING ON NETWORK CONGESTION OR NETWORK
EXHAUSTION. YOU'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON REALLY FOCUSING ON
THE HIGH REQUEST LOAD ON THE WEB SERVER OR MAYBE THE CDN. BUT
ULTIMATELY, IN A LOT OF CASES, THE ACTUAL ORIGIN BEHIND IT. AND
SO LAYER SEVEN ATTACKS ARE REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE
THEY'VE EVOLVED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. TO GIVE AN IDEA,
WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER, THE LAYER
SEVEN ATTACKS, THE WAY THEY'RE REALLY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS
SET UP IS A THREAT. ACTOR WILL GET ONE MULTIPLE, SOMETIMES
DOZENS. WE'VE EVEN SEEN UP TO 100 WHAT WE CALL PROXY DRIVERS.
AND THESE ARE MACHINES THAT PRETTY MUCH BUILD IDENTICALLY.
THEY LOAD THE SAME NODEJS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE DDOS ATTACK
TOOLS ARE ACTUALLY NODEJS TOOLS ON THEM, AND THEY BASICALLY FEED
IT WITH A PROXY LIST AND SO THEY CAN GET THESE OFF THE INTERNET.
THERE'S AN OPEN PROXY LIST. THEY USUALLY HAVE MAYBE 5 TO 10,000
OF THEM AT ANY GIVEN TIME ON THE INTERNET. IN SOME CASES THEY MAY
DIP INTO WHAT WE CALL PRIVATE PROXY NETWORKS, WHICH ARE
TYPICALLY YOU HAVE TO PAY INTO. AND THAT COULD GIVE YOU ACCESS
TO RESIDENTIAL NODES OR DATA CENTER PROXIES, WHICH ARE A
LITTLE BIT MORE PERFORMANT THAN THESE OPEN PROXIES, MAINLY
BECAUSE THESE OPEN PROXIES ARE BEING ABUSED BY SO MANY PEOPLE
FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS, SUCH AS DDOS, CRUD, STUFFING, RANDOM
SCANNING, MOTION SCANNING. AND SO THEY'RE KIND OF THEY DON'T
ALWAYS WORK AT THAT RELIABLY. SO THIS IS REALLY KIND OF THE
INFRASTRUCTURE BEHIND HOW A LOT OF LAYER SEVEN REQUEST FLOODS
ARE BASICALLY ORCHESTRATED NOW, OR USED TO BE THAT WITH A LOT OF
THE LAYER SEVEN REQUEST FLOODS, IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE REQUEST PER
SECOND, AND DRIVING THAT UP AND REALLY TRYING TO EXHAUST WHAT
YOU COULD DO ON THE WEB SERVER. OVER THE YEARS, THERE'S BEEN A
LOT OF LAYER SEVEN ANTI DDOS DEFENSIVE DEFENSES THAT HAVE
COME OUT OVER TIME. AND SO WAFS HAVE BEEN ONE TECHNIQUE THAT
PEOPLE HAVE USED TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW, LIMITING HOW MANY REQUESTS
YOU COULD DO PER SECOND FOR A GIVEN SOURCE IP LOOKING FOR
DIFFERENT KIND OF SIGNATURES. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE SIGNATURE
TECHNIQUE WAS WITH TLS CLIENT HELLO, ALSO KNOWN AS JIRA THREE
FINGERPRINTING. AND FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY
EFFECTIVE UNTIL IT BECAME TOO EFFECTIVE AND THEN IT WASN'T.
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN THAT HAPPENING WAS THREAT ACTORS HAVE
DECIDED, WELL, LET'S TRY TO CHANGE OUR SOFTWARE, BECAUSE
TYPICALLY WHEN THEY BUILD THOSE PROXY DRIVERS, THEY'RE PUTTING
THE SAME VERSION OF SOFTWARE IN EVERY SINGLE BOX. SO THE
SIGNATURE WAS SUPER CLEAR. NOW THEY'VE ACTUALLY CHANGED A LOT
OF THE SOFTWARE AROUND WHERE NOW THEY CAN DO SOME LEVEL OF
RANDOMIZATION TO MAKE THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE TRICKIER. OTHER
KIND OF INNOVATIONS FROM AN ATTACK PERSPECTIVE ARE NOT JUST
GOING AND DOING A GET SLASH, BUT ACTUALLY GOING AND TRYING TO DO
A GET SLASH, SOME KIND OF RANDOM VALUE OR SOME SORT OF RANDOM
QUERIES, SOMETHING THAT ISN'T CACHEABLE, SOMETHING THAT
ACTUALLY HAS TO GO BACK AND HIT THE ORIGIN UNIQUELY AND TRY TO
DRIVE THAT LOAD. SO IT'S LESS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, JUST GETTING
THAT HIGH RPS, WHICH ON THE HIGH END, SINCE MAYBE IN THE MILLIONS
OF REQUESTS PER SECOND, BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW DO YOU EVADE AND
ACTUALLY TRY TO GET ENOUGH THROUGH TO ACTUALLY GO AFTER THE
ORIGIN AND CAUSE TROUBLE. AND THEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS,
THERE'S BEEN SOME USE OF HTTP TWO, AND SO TRADITIONALLY IT WAS
OKAY, WELL, HTTP ONE, YOU CAN ONLY GET SO MANY REQUESTS
THROUGH HTTP TWO. OPEN THE DOORS. IN TERMS OF GETTING
HAVING A LOT MORE SESSIONS THAT YOU CAN RUN ON A GIVEN TCP
SESSION. AND BACK IN 2023, AND IT BECAME PUBLIC IN OCTOBER
2023, WAS THE HTTP TWO RAPID RESET ATTACK. AND THAT BASICALLY
ALLOWED YOU TO HAVE THAT ONE TCP SESSION WHERE YOU CAN HAVE ALL
THESE INDIVIDUAL HTTP REQUESTS SESSIONS OVER THEM, AND YOU
COULD BASICALLY SAY REQUEST FOR SOMETHING. AND THEN THE CLIENT
WOULD SAY, FORGET ABOUT IT, CANCEL IT. BUT THE WEB SERVER
HAS ALREADY GOTTEN THAT REQUEST. AND SO IT'S GOING TO DO THAT
WORK AND RESPOND WITH AN ANSWER THAT YOU BASICALLY SAID I DON'T
CARE ABOUT ANYMORE. SO YOU SAW THESE REQUEST FLOODS THAT WERE
MAYBE AT THE TOP END OF A FEW MILLION REQUESTS PER SECOND, ALL
OF A SUDDEN GOING FROM ZERO TO HERO TO LIKE 50 MILLION, WELL
INTO LIKE 100 MILLION PLUS RANGE. RIGHT? SO IT WAS A PRETTY
INTERESTING AMPLIFIER. AND SO THE INDUSTRY RESPONDED BACK WITH
COMING UP WITH MORE CREATIVE MITIGATIONS TO DEAL WITH HTTP
TWO, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
INNOVATION BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT ATTACK TYPE. IT
DOESN'T REQUIRE A NETWORK CONGESTION TYPE OF TECHNIQUES.
SO ONE THING I DID TALK ABOUT EARLIER HERE WAS WITH SOURCE IP
SPOOFING, AMPLIFICATION AND REFLECTION ATTACKS. SO IT'S AN
INTERESTING ONE WHERE SOMEBODY HAS TO GET A HOST SOMEWHERE
WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY SPOOF. AND MOST CLOUD PROVIDERS, MOST
LARGE HOSTING PROVIDERS, AND MOST THANKFULLY FOR A LOT OF
GOOD WORK THAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE OVER THE INDUSTRY, HAVE MADE IT
SO THAT MOST BROADBAND PROVIDERS DON'T ALLOW IP SPOOFING SOURCE
IP SPOOFING. BUT THERE'S STILL A NUMBER OF KIND OF SMALLER
HOSTING ENVIRONMENTS THAT YOU CAN GO TO, AND YOU GET A
DEDICATED SERVER AND IN SOME CASES, VMS THAT STILL ALLOW
SPOOFING. AND SO THEY GO, THEY GET THESE AMPLIFIER LISTS THAT
EITHER THEY SCAN THEMSELVES OR THEY GET PROVIDED, AND IT GIVES
THEM THE LIST OF AMPLIFIERS AND DIFFERENT SERVICES TO GO AND USE
TO BASICALLY GENERATE TARGETS TO LAUNCH ATTACKS TO, TO REFLECT
AND HIT THE, THE DESTINATION. AND SO THIS IS AN AREA OVER THE
LAST FEW YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN ACTIVE IN WITH OTHER COMPANIES
AS WELL, AND TO TRYING TO FIND IDENTIFY WHAT NETWORKS ARE
ALLOWING SPOOFING AND HAVE ACTUAL ATTACKS, YOU KNOW,
LEAVING FROM THEIR NETWORK AND TRY TO GET IT SHUT DOWN. AND SO
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE DIRECTLY ENGAGE WITH THOSE NETWORKS WHEN
WE FIND THEM, BECAUSE WE PAIR WITH A LARGE SET OF NETWORKS
AROUND THE GLOBE. WE CAN SEE THE SPOOF TRAFFIC COMING IN. WE CAN
GO AND REPORT TO THEM. AND THAT REPORTING IS INTERESTING, RIGHT?
BECAUSE IT'S AT THAT POINT IT'S YOU TALKING TO ANOTHER HUMAN,
WHETHER IT BE A NOC OR AN ABUSE DEPARTMENT OR SOME KIND OF
ESCALATION CONTACT. AND SO YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS TO SAY, HEY,
WE SAW THIS PACKET COME OUT OF YOUR NETWORK. IT WAS, YOU KNOW,
A LARGE AMOUNT OF PACKETS. IT WAS ALL ONE PARTICULAR SOURCE IP
TO THIS DESTINATION, YOU KNOW, DESTINATION PORT TYPICALLY. AND
TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THEM, SAY, CAN YOU USE WHAT NETFLOW DATA YOU
CAN HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE SOURCE
IS AND EITHER TALK TO YOUR CUSTOMER OR TRY TO SHUT IT DOWN,
APPLY SOME SORT OF ANTI-SPOOFING FILTERS. AND SO FREQUENTLY WE
HAVE TO FIND THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF NETWORKS AREN'T REALLY
PROFICIENT AT THIS, USING A PICTURE LIKE THIS ACTUALLY HELPS
QUITE A LOT TO BASICALLY SAY, LOOK, YOU'RE THE ISP, I NEED YOU
TO GO FIND YOUR CUSTOMER BEHIND YOU THAT GENERATED THIS THING.
PLEASE USE YOUR TOOLS TO GO DO THAT. AND SO WE'LL WORK WITH AN
INDIVIDUAL VARIOUS PAIRS ALL OVER THE GLOBE TO TRY TO DO
THAT. WHENEVER WE SEE THESE KIND OF HOTSPOTS SET UP, BECAUSE
THAT'S USUALLY A BOOTER OR STRESSER WHO'S BASICALLY
ESTABLISHED SOME SORT OF OPERATION AT A PARTICULAR
HOSTING PROVIDER, AND THEY'LL KEEP OPERATING UNTIL THEY
EVENTUALLY GET SHUT OFF. NOW IT GETS A LITTLE COMPLICATED,
THOUGH, AS YOU TALK WITH A LOT OF THESE EXTERNAL NETWORKS, YOU
BASICALLY BRING THIS KIND OF INFORMATION TO THEM AND ASK
THEM, WELL, CAN YOU TRY AND FIND THE SPOOFING? AND YOU GET A
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ANSWERS. AND A LOT OF IT COMES DOWN TO
THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT REALLY USED TO THESE SORTS OF REQUESTS.
SO A COMMON ONE IS WHEN YOU SEND IT AND SAY, HEY, I SAW THIS
SOURCE IP AT THIS TIMESTAMP GOING TO UDP PORT 389 WINDOWS
CLOUD APP. CAN YOU GO AND USE YOUR NETFLOW DATA TO TRY TO FIND
THE SOURCE? A COMMON ANSWER IS, WELL, THAT'S NOT OUR IP ADDRESS.
WE DON'T ANNOUNCE THAT TO THE INTERNET. IT'S LIKE, I KNOW IT'S
BECAUSE THE SOURCE IP WAS SPOOFED THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE
POINT. I NEED YOU TO GO AND ACTUALLY TRY TO FIND THE SOURCE
OF IT. SOMETIMES WE'LL SEND EVEN AMAZON IPS ARE BEING SPOOFED
WHEN THEY SEND TO OUR NETWORK AND WE'RE LIKE, THEY'RE LIKE,
WELL, YOU MADE A MISTAKE. THAT'S YOUR IP. I'M LIKE, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO. IT'S BEEN SPOOFED ON YOUR SIDE. WE NEED YOU TO LOOK
AT IT. COMMON PROBLEM IS THAT THEY WHEN THEY THINK DDOS, THEY
THINK DESTINATION IP. SO THEY ASK, WELL WHAT ARE THE
DESTINATION IPS? I'M LIKE, WELL IT'S TRUE A LOT OF AMPLIFIER
REFLECTORS. IT'S A REALLY LONG LIST. IF YOU'RE FIXING A
DESTINATION IP, YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT WRONG. YOU NEED TO STEP
BACK THERE. SOMETIMES YOU GET KIND OF INTERESTING RESULTS.
LIKE ONE PARTICULAR NETWORK SAID. THEY OFFERED SAY, OH,
WELL, IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DDOS, YOU SHOULD BUY SOME OF OUR
DDOS SCRUBBING SERVICES. LIKE, NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO DO. SO THERE'S A FEW OTHER ONES. SOMETIMES THEY STRUGGLE
WITH SOME OF THE NETFLOW RELATED TOOLING, AND BECAUSE IT'S A
DIFFERENT SORT OF REQUEST THAT THEY'RE USED TO. SO SOMETIMES
THEY'LL SHOW SOME OF THEIR NETFLOW TOOLS, SOMETIMES THEY'RE
THIRD PARTIES. WE KNOW PEOPLE AT THOSE COMPANIES, AND WE CAN
INTRODUCE THEM AND KIND OF HELP THEM TO BE LIKE, THIS IS HOW YOU
DO A QUERY TO FIND THE SOURCE. AND SO THAT ONE ONE DAY I
DECIDED TO KIND OF COLLECT SOME OF THESE, BINGO, THESE, THESE
ITEMS HERE AND PUT THEM INTO A BINGO CARD. I'VE HIT ALL OF THEM
SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES. SO BUT THE POINT IS REALLY NOT TO LIKE
PARTICULARLY COUNT ON ANY PARTICULAR NETWORK. IT'S REALLY
MORE ABOUT THERE'S A TECHNICAL PROFICIENCY THING AND IT'S
REALLY ABOUT EDUCATING BECAUSE IT'S JUST ME AND OUR FOLKS WITH
EMAIL CLIENTS. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO MAKE A NETWORK,
PARTICULARLY STOP SPOOFING. IT'S ALL ABOUT REALLY TO INFORM AND
TRY TO GET TO A PARTICULAR OUTCOME, WHICH IS WE WANT TO TRY
TO GET THIS ACTIVITY SHUT DOWN. SO IT'S ABOUT EXPLAINING AND
EDUCATING TO OTHERS AND TEACHING THEM THIS IS HOW YOU ACTUALLY GO
AND FIND THIS, AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN BECOME PROFICIENT ENOUGH IN
WHERE YOU CAN FIND IT ON YOUR OWN. AND SO IT'S AN ONGOING KIND
OF EDUCATIONAL THING AND WHERE YOU WANT TO DRIVE THE RIGHT
BEHAVIOR, WHICH IS IF YOU'RE A HOSTING PROVIDER, THERE'S NO
REASON WHY YOU WANT TO ALLOW SPOOFING TO A PARTICULAR
DEDICATED HOST OR VM LIKE BY DEFAULT, LIKE THAT. THAT IS NOT
THE RIGHT THING. SO I'LL WALK THROUGH ONE PARTICULAR SCENARIO
THAT HAPPENED A MID 2024. IN THIS CASE, THIS IS AN
INTERESTING CASE OF A SIN AND SIN REFLECTION. AND SO BACK IN
SUMMER 2024, WE SAW A LARGE SET OF SOURCE IPS WERE TRANSMITTING
A FAIR AMOUNT OF TCP SINS TO EVERY AMAZON IP FOR MANY HOURS
AT A TIME. AND SO IT WAS MULTIPLE 20 FOURS TOGETHER,
WHICH IS KIND OF UNIQUE. RIGHT. AND IT WAS ON 80 AND 443. AND
BECAUSE USUALLY IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A WEB SERVER, THOSE PORTS
WOULD ANSWER IF YOU SEND A PACKET THERE. WHAT WAS UNIQUE
ABOUT SOME OF THE SOURCES BEING SPOOFED? THEY WERE ALL KIND OF
SOUTH AMERICAN ISPS. AND THE INTENT HERE IS THAT THEY WERE
INSTEAD OF DOING A UDP AMPLIFICATION REFLECTION ATTACK,
THEY WERE DOING A TCP SYN SYN-ACK REFLECTION. SO THAT'S
BASICALLY THEY SEND A SYN PORT IS OPEN, THEY GET A SYN ACK BACK
AND USUALLY A FEW SNACKS COME BACK. SO THE AMPLIFICATION
FACTOR ISN'T THAT GREAT, BUT YOU STILL GET SOMETHING THAT BOUNCES
BACK. NOW IF YOU WERE ON THE TARGET SIDE OF THIS, YOU WOULD
SEE A LOT OF SNACKS COMING INTO YOUR NETWORK, RIGHT? AND THAT'S
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO PROBABLY BE REALLY CAREFUL IF YOU WANT TO
FILTER, IF YOU FILTER THAT, BECAUSE THAT COULD BE LEGITIMATE
CONNECTIVITY. SO YOU NEED TO BE SOME CAUTION THAT YOU NEED TO
TAKE CARE. FROM A SIZE PERSPECTIVE. WE SAW MILLIONS OF,
I'D SAY TENS OF MILLIONS OF TCP SYN PACKETS WERE BEING SENT AT A
GIVEN TIME, USUALLY FOR HOURS LIKE SIX EIGHT HOURS OR SO, AND
THEN WOULD CONTINUE THE NEXT DAY. SO IT REALLY GOT US KIND OF
THINKING. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO HEARD FROM A
BACKCHANNEL WAS THAT SOME OF THESE NETWORKS THAT WERE BEING
TARGETED HAD MENTIONED THAT A HOSTING PROVIDER WHO ALSO
PROVIDES DDOS PROTECTION WAS APPROACHING THEM AFTERWARDS AND
SAYING, HEY, DO YOU NEED SOME DDOS DEFENSE CAPABILITIES? AND
SO THAT KIND OF MADE US THINK LIKE, OH, INTERESTING, OH, WHO
IS THAT NETWORK? AND SO TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AT A HIGH LEVEL, IT
KIND OF LOOKED LIKE THIS, WHERE WE SAW TRAFFIC ATTEMPTING TO
BOUNCE OFF OUR RESOURCES. WE TALKED TO A FEW OTHER NETWORK
OPERATORS AS WELL, AND THEY SAID, YEAH, WE SEE A LOT OF
THESE TCP SIMS TWO COMING FROM THESE SAME RANGES ON, ON THE
SAME SET OF DESTINATION PORTS. IT'S LIKE, OKAY, SO SOMEBODY OUT
THERE IS CLEARLY SPRAYING ALL THIS TO TRY TO DO THIS
REFLECTION TO TARGET AT SOMETHING. AND SO WE ENGAGED OUR
UPSTREAM NETWORK WHERE WE SAW THE SPOOFED PACKETS COME IN
FROM. WE TALKED TO THEM AND SAID, HEY, CAN YOU TRACE THIS
BACK? AND AS THEY WERE LOOKING INTO IT, WE ALSO SAID, YOU KNOW,
WE NOTICED THERE'S THIS ONE HOSTING PROVIDER. THEY HAPPEN TO
BE A CUSTOMER OF YOURS TOO. YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEM.
AND THEY DID. AND THERE WAS SOME SORT OF ENGAGEMENT THERE. AND
EVENTUALLY THE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY GOT FILTERED, WHERE ALL OF
A SUDDEN THE TRAFFIC STOPPED. WE THOUGHT, OKAY, THAT'S PRETTY
COOL. EVERYTHING'S GOOD. THEY FOUND THE RIGHT SOURCE OF IT.
BUT THEN THE NEXT DAY WE SAW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT CAME IN FROM
ANOTHER TRANSIT PROVIDER, THOUGHT, OKAY, HEY, THAT HOSTING
PROVIDER. THEY ALSO ARE BEHIND THAT OTHER THE SECOND PROVIDER
TO LET'S GO REACH OUT AND TALK TO OUR TRANSIT PROVIDER AND
MAYBE KIND OF POINT THEM IN THAT DIRECTION TO SAY, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. AND THEY DO. AND EVENTUALLY IT GETS
FILTERED AND THEY ATTACK TRAFFIC STOPS. NOW WHAT WAS ALSO
INTERESTING IS THAT PARTICULAR HOSTING PROVIDER, WE ACTUALLY
HAPPENED TO PAIR WITH THEM IN A PARTICULAR, OFTEN INTERNET
EXCHANGE IN SOMEPLACE IN NORTH AMERICA. AND WE THOUGHT, WELL,
THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. IF WE'RE SEEING ALL THE SPOOFED
TRAFFIC AND IT'S COMING FROM THEM, HOW COME THEY NEVER SEND
IT ON THE INTERNET EXCHANGE WITH US BEFORE? LIKE WE'RE ANNOUNCING
THEM PREFIXES? HOW COME WE NEVER SAW IT? BUT THEN WE STARTED
SEEING AFTER THESE TWO TRANSIT PROVIDERS APPLIED SOME
FILTERING, WE STARTED SEEING IT DIRECTLY COMING INTO OUR NETWORK
WHERE WE HAVE A PAIRING ADJACENCY WITH THEM. SO AT THAT
POINT WE SEE THE DATA. IT'S CLEAR IT'S COMING IN. I CAN SEE
THEIR SOURCE MAC ADDRESS OF THE ROUTER. I ENGAGE WITH THEM
DIRECTLY AND THEY GET AUTOMATED KIND OF A TICKETING SYSTEM. AND
THEY SAID THEY'RE LOOKING INTO IT. AND THEN AFTER THAT THE
ATTACK TRAFFIC STOPPED AND IT DIDN'T. IT STOPPED FOR QUITE A
WHILE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. IT DID. IT COME BACK A FEW MONTHS
LATER ON THROUGH ONE OF THE TRANSIT PROVIDERS, I BELIEVE,
UNFILTERED THEM FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN
REAPPLIED IT. AND THEN WE SAW IT COME BACK ON OUR INTERNET
EXCHANGE EXCHANGE PORTS AGAIN, ENGAGE WITH THAT NETWORK AGAIN.
AND WE DID. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TRAFFIC STOPPED FOR AND
SINCE THEN. SO KIND OF ODD ODD BEHAVIOR, IT KIND OF GETS INTO
ANOTHER TOPIC WHICH IS SUSPICIOUS HOSTING PROVIDERS.
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE IS WHEN WE SEE SOME OF THIS
DDOS ACTIVITY, WHETHER IT'S SPOOFING LAYER SEVEN, PROXY
DRIVERS, C2 INFRASTRUCTURE, WE SEE THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN
NUMBER OF ASNS WHERE THIS STUFF TYPICALLY GRAVITATES AROUND, AND
IT SEEMS TO BE VERY PERSISTENT THAT THESE PARTICULAR NETWORKS
SEEM TO HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF IT. SAME GOES FOR SCANNING
ACTIVITIES, TOO. WE SEE IT FOR AMPLIFIER REFLECTOR PROXY
SCANNING COME FROM SOME OF THE SAME ASNS OVER AND OVER AND
OVER. IN ONE CASE, THERE'S ONE HOSTING PROVIDER HAD A TELEGRAM
CHANNEL. WE SEE THEIR EMPLOYEES IN THERE. WE ALSO SEE THEIR
CUSTOMERS IN THERE. THEY'RE OPENLY TALKING ABOUT IP
SPOOFING. SO IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE THEY MIGHT BE LOOKING THE
OTHER WAY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO NOTICED IS SOME OF
THESE PARTICULAR NETWORKS, THESE SPECIFIC ASNS, THEY SEEM TO BE
GETTING BOUNCED FROM TRANSIT PROVIDER TO TRANSIT PROVIDER,
FROM WHAT WE COULD TELL LOOKS LIKE DUE TO ABUSE ISSUES. AND SO
THEY'RE GETTING KICKED AROUND, KICKED OFF AND MOVING TO
DIFFERENT NETWORKS. AND UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE IN CERTAIN
PARTS OF THE WORLD, THERE'S A VERY LIVELY IP TRANSIT MARKET.
SO THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF SMALLER NETWORKS THAT THEY CAN
GO TO BUY THAT CONNECTIVITY. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A PATTERN THAT
WE'VE WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WHERE A LOT OF THIS STUFF
KIND OF CLUSTERS AROUND THAT. LET ME HAND IT BACK OVER TO
STEVEN. ALL RIGHT. >> THANKS, TOM. OKAY. SO WE JUST
LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE BAD ACTIVITY THAT WE CAN HONE IN ON
JUST FROM KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE ON OUR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE OF
THE BACKBONE LINKS THAT FLOW INTO THE AWS DATA CENTERS. SO
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DETECT FROM LOOKING AT A LITTLE
BIT OF A HIGHER LEVEL TELEMETRY, AWS SERVICE INTERACTIONS, AND
HOW WE CAN USE THAT TO SECURE CUSTOMER RESOURCES. SO,
CLOUDTRAIL, I IMAGINE YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THIS IS A GREAT
APPLICATION LAYER AUDIT LOG OF THE THOUSANDS OF INTERACTION
TYPES THAT WORKING WITH AWS CREATES AND CLOUDTRAIL CAPTURES
BOTH USER DRIVEN WORKFLOWS AS WELL AS AUTOMATED SYSTEM
INTERACTIONS. YOUR PROGRAMMATIC STUFF, YOUR API CALLS. SO IT'S A
TREASURE TROVE OF DETAILS. IT'S REALLY A MAP OF YOU KNOW WHO,
WHAT, WHEN AND WHERE. FOR EVERY INTERACTION THAT OCCURS IN YOUR
ACCOUNTS, RIGHT? SO YOU GET DETAILS LIKE WHAT IS THE SOURCE
IP ADDRESS AND USER IDENTITY OF THE CLIENT CALLER. WHAT DID THEY
ACTUALLY TRY TO DO? YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS THE EVENT NAME, EVENT
SOURCE? REALLY RICH DETAILS AROUND THE REQUEST AND RESPONSE
THEMSELVES. AND THEN A TIME STAMP WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING
GREAT. WHAT REGION THIS INFORMATION WAS LOGGED. SO
YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF THE TECHNIQUES THAT I'M GOING TO
DESCRIBE IN A BIT ARE APPLIED IN OUR PUBLIC SERVICES LIKE
GUARDDUTY, LIKE INSPECTOR, TO GIVE CUSTOMERS DIRECT CONTROL
INTO RISK VISIBILITY AND THEN AUTOMATION HOOKS THAT YOU CAN
DRIVE WHATEVER CUSTOM WORKFLOWS YOU WANT OFF OF THE FINDINGS
FROM THOSE SERVICES. SO WHAT DO WE LOOK FOR IN CLOUDTRAIL? ONE
REALLY GREAT SIGNAL IS WE'VE HEARD IT AS IP ADDRESS AFFINITY.
LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL CLIENT IP ADDRESS, HOW OFTEN DOES IT
INTERACT WITH ACCOUNT A HOW OFTEN DOES IT INTERACT WITH
SERVICE X IN ACCOUNT? A HOW OFTEN DOES IT INTERACT WITH
OTHER ACCOUNTS AND OTHER SERVICES? AND AS WE START
CHARACTERIZING THAT, WE CAN BUILD A MAP OF WHAT WHAT IS
NORMAL FOR THIS CLIENT TO BE INTERACTING WITH AND WHAT IS
ABNORMAL AND PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL. THEN UNUSUAL
SEQUENCES OF ACTIONS WITHIN THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR AWS ACCOUNT,
RIGHT? IF YOU LOOK AT NORMAL IN AN ACCOUNT, IS IT USUALLY USED
TO RUN ECS WORKLOADS, KUBERNETES, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
AND THEN ONE DAY YOU START SEEING CLOUDTRAIL RECORDS WHERE
SOMEONE'S TRYING TO CONFIGURE SIMPLE EMAIL SERVICE AND USE
THAT TO SEND OUTBOUND MESSAGES. IS THAT NORMAL? I DON'T KNOW.
BREADTH OF DESCRIBE ACTIONS. DESCRIBE IS A VERY COMMON PREFIX
IN CLOUDTRAIL EVENTS WHERE YOU'LL SEE DESCRIBE INSTANCES,
DESCRIBE TABLES. DESCRIBE USERS, ETC. SO IS THIS ARE YOU SEEING
THIS BROADLY ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT SERVICES IN YOUR
ACCOUNT? IF SO, THAT COULD BE A GOOD SIGNAL. THERE'S SOMEBODY IN
THERE TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT ACCESS DO THEY HAVE. RIGHT.
WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES WITHIN THIS ACCOUNT. SO WHAT ABOUT
SERVICES THAT YOUR ACCOUNT DOES NOT USE FREQUENTLY? TALKED ABOUT
VPNS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. ANONYMIZING VPN USAGE,
PARTICULARLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENT EVENTS AND
CLOUDTRAIL. CREATING A RESOURCE. MODIFYING A RESOURCE WITH AN IP
ADDRESS THAT ISN'T KNOWN TO YOUR NETWORK, OR THAT YOU CAN CLEARLY
LINK TO A PARTICULAR VPN SERVICE. AGAIN, LITTLE UNUSUAL
SUSPECT. AND THEN A GREAT INDICATOR FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF THREAT ANALYTICS IS JUST HIGH FAILURE RATES. THREAT
ACTORS NEED TO RESEARCH. THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY
HAVE ACCESS TO, WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. SO WHEN YOU
START SEEING LOTS OF 400, THREE, 400, FOUR, 500 RESPONSES IN YOUR
IN CLOUDTRAIL OR IN YOUR SERVICE APPLICATION LOGS, THAT'S THAT'S
AN INDICATOR, A BREADCRUMB OF HEY, SOMETHING'S FAILING A LOT.
SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS OR DOING SOMETHING UNUSUAL. SO IS
THIS HAPPENING ACROSS ALL YOUR USERS OR PARTICULAR USER
IDENTITIES? SO NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE LIKE A SMOKING GUN.
OH, THIS IS THREAT ACTIVITY. BUT WHEN YOU START SEEING THEM
STACKED UP TOGETHER AND CO-OCCURRING, IT MAKES YOU
QUESTION, IS THIS REALLY LEGITIMATE? SO USING THIS NEW
LENS ON TOP OF THE NETWORK TELEMETRY THAT WE DESCRIBED,
LOOKING AT SERVICE INTERACTIONS, LET'S DIG INTO SOME ACTUAL
THREAT ACTIVITY THAT WE SEE IN THIS SPACE. OKAY. SO MANY THREAT
ACTORS ARE NOT EVEN DOING ANYTHING PARTICULARLY
SOPHISTICATED. THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF INEXPERIENCE.
THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MISTAKES, AND THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR INSECURE CONFIGURATIONS OF APPS ON THE INTERNET. RIGHT.
THERE'S A LOT OF SERVICES THAT ARE REALLY DESIGNED TO BE RUN IN
PRIVATE NETWORKS OR SORT OF DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST TEN
YEARS LONGER BEFORE ZERO TRUST REALLY BECAME A POPULAR NETWORK
ARCHITECTURE, AND THEY DON'T HAVE SUPER STRONG AUTHENTICATION
CONTROLS BAKED IN. OR MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN BOLTED ON, AND IT
TAKES EXTRA WORK TO REALLY GET THAT INTO A STRONG, INTERNET
EXPOSED POSTURE. SO THINGS LIKE DATABASES, DO YOU HAVE YOUR SQL
SERVER, YOUR POSTGRES OR MYSQL WITH A PUBLIC IP ADDRESS, AND
PERHAPS IT'S JUST PROTECTED WITH A USERNAME PASSWORD COMBO, MAYBE
EVEN NO ENCRYPTION ON THE NETWORK CONNECTION. THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CREDENTIAL STUFFED. AND POTENTIALLY IF YOU
HAVE A DEFAULT APPLICATION INSTALLED THERE, MAYBE THEIR
DEFAULT CREDS AND SOMEBODY CAN GET ACCESS TO YOUR DATABASE ON
THE INTERNET. LOG SEARCH CLUSTERS. PROMETHEUS. GRAFANA.
ELASTIC. REALLY POPULAR, POWERFUL TOOLS FOR UNDERSTANDING
ALL THE DATA THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION COLLECTS. YOUR
APPLICATION COLLECTS. BUT DO YOU HAVE IT SECURE? DOES IT HAVE A
PUBLIC IP ADDRESS? IF SO, IT'S POSSIBLE. HEY, UNAUTHORIZED
ACTOR COULD JUST HIT THE APIS LIKE YOU DO AND LOOK FOR
WHATEVER INFORMATION YOU MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HAVE INDEXED IN
THAT CLUSTER, RIGHT? SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING SENSITIVE IN
THERE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY THAT THAT'S THE SORT OF
INFORMATION THAT THREAT ACTORS ARE LOOKING FOR. AND THEN
ANALYTIC CLUSTERS LIKE SPARK, HADOOP, THESE ARE ACTUALLY
DESIGNED TO EXECUTE CODE THAT YOU UPLOAD TO THEM. RIGHT. WHICH
IS JUST A GOLD MINE FOR ANYBODY WHO'S LOOKING TO, YOU KNOW, GET
FREE COMPUTE ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S BILL FOR CRYPTO MINING,
PHISHING, ETC. SO I WAS LOOKING AT GITHUB YESTERDAY, LOOKING AT
SOME POPULAR OPEN SOURCE TOOLING AND THE NUMBER OF READMES THAT I
SAW WERE JUST LIKE GETTING INTRODUCED TO A PACKAGE. THE
VERY FIRST THING IT SAYS GETTING STARTED AND THEN IMMEDIATELY
UNDER, IT'S LIKE, DO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION. LIKE HOW COMMON
IS OPEN SOURCE SET UP THAT WAY OF LIKE, HERE'S HOW TO GET
STARTED, BUT DON'T DO THIS. PEOPLE DO IT RIGHT. AND SO YOU
SEE POPULAR OPEN SOURCE TOOLING LIKE CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,
I THINK THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WORDPRESS SITES OUT
THERE, SOME OF WHICH ARE RUNNING OLD VERSIONS, MIGHT HAVE DEFAULT
CREDENTIALS, MAY HAVE THEIR WEB ROOT MISCONFIGURED DEPLOYMENT
AUTOMATION SYSTEMS. JENKINS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE IT HAS
PRIVILEGED ACCESS ON YOUR NETWORK. IT MAY HAVE SECRETS TO
LOG IN TO OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION HAS, AND
THERE'S A BIG ECOSYSTEM OF PLUGINS THAT YOU CAN INSTALL
THAT HAVE VARYING QUALITY AND TESTING LEVELS. SO IN ALL OF
THESE CASES, IF THREAT ACTORS SCANNING THE BROAD INTERNET
DISCOVER ONE OF THESE INSECURE CONFIGURATIONS, THEY'RE GOING TO
DO THE BAD STUFF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEY'RE GOING TO
CRYPTOMINERS, THEY'RE GOING TO STEAL CREDIT STUFF THE WORKS.
RIGHT. AND WE SEE IT EVERY DAY. SO SPEAKING OF CREDENTIAL THEFT
AND ABUSE, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT IS PREVALENT RIGHT
NOW. IT'S EASIER TO LOG IN TO A SERVICE THAN IT IS TO EXECUTE
SOME COMPLEX ATTACK CHAIN WITH SOPHISTICATED TOOLING OR REVERSE
ENGINEERING EXPLOIT DEVELOPMENT. SO BECAUSE OF THAT, THERE'S A
REALLY ACTIVE BLACK MARKET FOR CREDENTIAL RESALE. AND WHERE
THREAT ACTORS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO LIKE GATHER CREDENTIALS,
WHETHER THEY WORK OR NOT, WHETHER THEY'RE VALID OR NOT,
AND BUNDLE THEM UP, RESELL THEM. SO WE SEE CONTINUALLY JUST
INTERNET TRAFFIC COMING INTO OUR DATA CENTERS LOOKING FOR EXPOSED
CREDENTIALS AND WELL-KNOWN LOCATIONS. ABOUT 500 MILLION
REQUESTS PER DAY, JUST HUNTING FOR WHETHER THERE'S AN EXPOSED
ENV FILE THAT MIGHT HAVE ACCESS KEYS OR USERNAME PASSWORD
COMBOS, OR API KEYS TO A SERVICE. THAT'S A LOT. IN
ADDITION TO THE INTERNET CONNECTED SERVICES THAT MIGHT
ACCIDENTALLY LEAK KEYS, THREAT ACTORS ALSO TARGET INDIVIDUALS.
THEY'RE NOT JUST TARGETING SERVICES. THEY MIGHT GO AFTER,
YOU KNOW, AN EXECUTIVE, A HELP DESK PERSON. YOU KNOW, ANYBODY
IN AN ORGANIZATION THAT JUST HAPPENS TO FALL INTO ONE OF
THESE, THESE AVENUES. SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS FOR
DISTRIBUTING MALWARE JUST FOR CREDENTIAL STEALING. PHISHING,
PEOPLE DOWNLOADING CRACKED SOFTWARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
TO PAY FOR A REAL LICENSE FOR, YOU KNOW, X, Y, OR Z. AND THEY
FIND SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET AND DOWNLOAD IT AND OH, OOPS, IT
ACTUALLY HITS A BACKDOOR. SOME THREAT ACTORS, IN FACT, WILL
EVEN PLACE ADS ON ADVERTISING NETWORKS THAT YOU YOU GET FED
INTO YOUR BROWSER AND THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BROWSER
VULNERABILITIES. AGAIN, TO INSTALL INFOSTEALER MALWARE. SO
IF ANY OF THESE MECHANISMS HAPPEN TO CATCH AWS CREDENTIALS,
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE THINGS THAT I WAS REFERRING TO
ON THE OTHER SLIDE OF CRYPTOMINING OUTBOUND PHISHING,
MALWARE STAGING. RIGHT. IT'S JUST EVERY TIME THREAT ACTORS
GET MORE RESOURCES IN THEIR NETWORK, THEY'RE JUST GOING TO
COPY PASTE THE BAD ACTIVITY. OKAY, SO ILLUSTRATING A QUICK
ATTACK CHAIN OF HOW YOU CAN PIVOT FROM AN INDIVIDUAL
WORKSTATION THAT MAYBE COMPROMISED OR LAPTOP PERSONAL
DEVICE INTO YOUR ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENT. IF YOU HAVE AN
INDIVIDUAL YOU CAN IMAGINE, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE SCENARIOS I
MENTIONED, MAYBE A HELP DESK ENGINEER OR SUPPORT ENGINEER
GETS A PHISHING EMAIL THAT THEY DOWNLOAD SOME DOCUMENT WITH
MALWARE STAGED IN IT. THAT MALWARE, THEN, IS GOING TO BE
ABLE TO SCAN THE MEMORY OF THAT BOX, LOOK AT SENSITIVE FILES,
LOOK AT REGISTRIES, PASSWORD MANAGERS, AND THEN THEY'RE GOING
TO EXFIL THOSE CREDS EITHER TO THREAT CONTROLLED INFRASTRUCTURE
OR IN SOME CASES, THEY MIGHT JUST TAKE OVER THE BOX AND START
CREDENTIAL STUFFING SERVICES DIRECTLY FROM THERE. AND SO THAT
TRANSITION FROM A INDIVIDUAL USER'S PERSONAL DEVICE OR
ENTERPRISE DEVICE TO YOUR SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE, WE SEE
THE CREDENTIAL STUFFING HAPPENING AGAIN AT A AT A VERY
HIGH RATE. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF REQUESTS. AND THEN IF THEY
HAVE SUCCESS WITH ANY OF THOSE CREDENTIALS, THEY'RE GOING TO
KEEP MOVING ON AND TRY TO COPY PASTE THAT AND JUST REPEAT THE
SUCCESS THAT THEY'VE HAD. SO ALL OF THIS IS SUPPORTED VIA EVASION
VIA THE NETWORK. RIGHT. SORT OF THE CLASSIC WAY THAT MANY
SECURITY SYSTEMS ARE SET UP IS YOU YOU HAVE ALLOWLIST AND YOU
HAVE BLOCKLISTS ON YOUR, ON YOUR NETWORK. WHO CAN ACCESS MY
PRIVATE RESOURCES. AND SO WHAT WE SEE IS THREAT ACTORS ATTEMPT
TO CIRCUMVENT THIS USING VPNS OR A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY STACK OF
HTTP AND SOCKS PROXIES WHERE THEIR TRAFFIC IS GOING TO COME
FROM DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HOP
FROM DIFFERENT IP ADDRESSES OVER AND OVER. SO THIS CAN BE
REPEATED VIA MULTI-TENANT HOSTERS COMPROMISED DEVICES LIKE
WE'VE DESCRIBED, WHICH OCCUR IN BOTH DATA CENTERS AS WELL AS IN
RESIDENCES. YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE SET TOP BOXES THAT YOU GET OR
YOUR HOME CAMERAS, ETC, LIKE, AGAIN, OFTENTIMES CONNECTED TO
THE INTERNET. AND THEN THIS IS A HIGHLY DYNAMIC SPACE. AS WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT. WE SEE A LOT OF ROTATION HERE, BUT IT'S RARELY
MORE THAN 50,000 IP ADDRESSES IS SORT OF LIKE THE TOTAL AMOUNT
THAT WE SEE THREAT ACTORS ABLE TO MARSHAL AT ANY GIVEN TIME
RARELY GOES BEYOND THAT, BECAUSE THREAT ACTORS ARE COST CONSCIOUS
AS WELL. BUT BECAUSE IT IS SO DYNAMIC, THERE'S OFTEN
LEGITIMATE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC THAT IS ALSO ON THESE NETWORK LINKS,
AND WE DON'T WANT TO BLOCK IT, AND WE DON'T WANT TO DISRUPT
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES. SO KEEPING UP WITH THIS DYNAMISM IS REALLY
THE CORE OPPORTUNITY HERE. OKAY. SO DIVING INTO AN ACTUAL CASE
STUDY OF WHERE ALL OF THESE TECHNIQUES I'M DESCRIBING SORT
OF CONVERGED INTO A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE. THIS WAS IN LATE 2024,
AND WE STARTED GETTING SOME REPORTS FROM CUSTOMERS THAT THAT
THEY WERE SEEING RANSOM NOTES IN THEIR THEIR S3 BUCKETS. HERE'S A
LITTLE REDACTED SAMPLE. ACTUAL RANSOM NOTE THAT WE RECEIVED,
WHERE YOU CAN SEE SOME DETAILS BEING ASKED. HEY, PAY US SOME
BITCOIN. IF YOU GIVE US BITCOIN, WE WILL RELEASE A DECRYPTION
CREDENTIAL TO YOU. IF YOU NEED ANY HELP, EMAIL THIS ADDRESS AND
WE'LL WORK WITH YOU. SO A PRETTY NOT GOOD THING TO BE SEEING IN
YOUR RESOURCES ONE DAY. AS WE SAW THIS ACTIVITY UNFOLDING AND
WE LOOKED AT WHAT'S GOING ON, WE HAD ACTUALLY FOUND ALL OF THE
KEYS THAT THE AWS ACCESS KEYS THAT WERE BEING USED IN THIS
CAMPAIGN, WE'D ACTUALLY DETECTED AS COMPROMISED PREVIOUSLY AND
HAD SENT NOTIFICATIONS TO CUSTOMERS. HEY, WE'RE WORRIED
THAT YOUR YOUR KEY MAY BE EXPOSED VIA SOME OF THESE LEAK
MECHANISMS WE DESCRIBED BEFORE. YOU SHOULD ROTATE. YOU SHOULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME SOME DIFFERENT BEST PRACTICES TO
ENSURE THAT YOUR CREDENTIALS ARE SAFE. AGAIN, OVER THE COURSE OF
A FEW DAYS WHERE THIS WAS UNFOLDING, SPEAKING TO THE
CREDENTIAL BLACK MARKET, WE ACTUALLY SAW MULTIPLE THREAT
ACTORS AT THE SAME TIME IN ACCOUNTS DOING MULTIPLE
DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES, LIKE ATTEMPTING TO SET UP EC2
INSTANCES TO PERFORM CRYPTO MINING, AS WELL AS THIS RANSOM
ACTIVITY, FOOTPRINTING, OUTBOUND, YOU KNOW, SPAM AND
PHISHING. AND SO THAT WAS INDICATIVE, HEY, THERE'S SOME
COORDINATED CAMPAIGN THAT'S HAPPENING HERE AMONGST SORT OF
LOOSELY AFFILIATED GROUPS. THEY'RE NOT DOING THE SAME
THING, BUT THEY'RE USING THE SAME CREDS THAT PROBABLY CAME
FROM THE SAME ACCESS BROKER. SO AGAIN, WE SAW ALL OF THIS
HAPPENING, RIGHT? THE ACTOR TOOLING, WE SAW IT. WE HAD THE
DETECTIONS. WE WERE LIKE, OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO BLOCK AT THE
NETWORK LEVEL, RIGHT. TRY TO STOP THE PAIN FOR OUR CUSTOMERS
BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO MORE. WE WANT TO HELP. WE WANT TO MAKE
THESE THESE THREAT ACTORS STAY AWAY FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. WHAT WE
SAW IS WITHIN A SINGLE DAY THEY FIGURED OUT, OH, WE'RE GETTING
BLOCKED AT THE NETWORK. AND THEY BROKE DOWN THEIR THEIR
OPERATIONS EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THEIR OPERATION. THEY CAME
THROUGH A DIFFERENT IP ADDRESS. RIGHT. SO WE HAD TO ADAPT AS
WELL. TURNED OUT TO BE AN INDONESIAN BASED ACTOR SELL. AND
LIKE EVEN ADDING TO THE FRUSTRATION HERE IN SOME CASES
WE HEARD REPORTS, HEY, THEY'RE ACTUALLY RUNNING LIKE A DOUBLE
EXTORTION SCAM WHERE THE ENCRYPTION KEYS THAT CUSTOMERS
ARE PAYING FOR DON'T EVEN WORK. RIGHT. AND YOU GET THAT, AND
THEN YOU FIND OUT, OH, YOU KNOW, NOW WE WANT MORE TO GIVE YOU THE
DECRYPTION KEY. SO AGAIN, NOT A GOOD STORY TO GO THROUGH. SO
PUTTING ALL THESE FACTORS TOGETHER WE TOOK OUR DETECTIONS
THAT WE HAD NOTIFIED CUSTOMERS ABOUT THAT WE SAW OF THE
TOOLING. AND WE ACTUALLY FED IT DIRECTLY INTO THE S3 AND
IDENTITY CONTROL PLANES AND DATA PLANES TO JUST STOP THIS
ACTIVITY COLD. THE ACTUAL TECHNIQUES THE ACTORS WERE USING
FOR THE ENCRYPTION. AND OVER THE COURSE OF THIS, ONCE WE HAD THIS
DEPLOYED, STOP THE ACTIVITY 100%. OVER 900 MILLION ATTEMPTS
TO ENCRYPT OBJECTS WERE STOPPED FROM THIS ACTIVITY. OKAY, SO
THAT'S WHERE THIS REALLY PAYS OFF FOR CUSTOMERS IS BEING ABLE
TO PUT ALL OF THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER AND WITH THE
NOTIFICATIONS AND WITH THE ACTIVE DEFENSE, ACTUALLY HELP
THE CUSTOMERS WORK THROUGH APPLICATION SECURITY ISSUES ON
THEIR OWN, WHERE THEY'RE LIKE, WE'RE GETTING NOTIFICATIONS
MULTIPLE TIMES THAT THESE KEYS MIGHT BE EXPOSED. AND SO THEY
THEY WERE ABLE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM AND BE
LIKE, WHY ARE THESE KEYS LEAKING? FIX THE CORE ISSUE. GO
BEYOND JUST THEIR AWS CREDENTIALS, BUT ACTUALLY OTHER
THINGS THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AND ULTIMATELY DRIVE REAL
PROACTIVE SECURITY OUTCOMES FROM THE THREAT INTELLIGENCE. AND SO
THIS IS THE GOLDEN PATH SCENARIO THAT WE SEE REGULARLY AND IS
REALLY THE BASELINE. AND THESE OTHER THREAT ACTIVITIES ARE SORT
OF THE ANOMALOUS SIDE OF THINGS. SO REALLY TAKING THIS TO A
SCALED IDEA. WE'VE GOT OTHER SOURCES OF DATA, BUT WE'D NEED A
LONGER TALK TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM AT THE DEPTH
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY, I WILL QUICKLY CALL OUT THE
SECURITY COMMUNITY INSIGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THERE ARE MANY
GREAT ORGANIZATIONS, SECURITY RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, ACTIVE
DEFENSE AND SECOPS ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT
SHARE THEIR RESEARCH THAT HELP GO AFTER THESE TYPES OF THREAT
ACTORS. AND THAT IS SO VALUABLE BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY
SYNTHESIZED SO MUCH OF THIS LOW LEVEL INFORMATION AND SHARED
VERY ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE. SO THAT'S HUGE THANKS TO ALL OUR
COLLABORATORS IN THIS SPACE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO KEEP THREAT ACTORS
AT BAY THROUGH THE COLLABORATION. SO ALL OF THESE
DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES SORT OF STACK UP TOGETHER. IF YOU'VE
HEARD OF THE PYRAMID OF PAIN, THIS IS SORT OF THE INVERSE OF
THAT, WHERE AT THE LOWER LEVEL WE HAVE DATA THAT IS IN THE
BROADEST, IT'S THE HIGHEST VOLUME AND IT'S THE CLOSEST TO
THE HARDWARE. SO IT REALLY GIVES YOU A PICTURE OF WHAT IS GOING
ON. GROUNDTRUTH. BUT THEN DATA SETS TOWARDS THE TOP. THEY'RE
SMALLER, THEY HAVE MORE CONTEXT BAKED IN. RIGHT? AND THEY OFFER
STRONGER SIGNALS OF INTENT BEHIND THE INTERACTION. AND SO
USING THIS, THIS PYRAMID OF STACK DATA, WE CAN MAKE THESE
REALLY BROADLY CONDITIONAL DETECTIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE
SENSORS AND DO IT SUPER FAST. SO WE CAN LOOK AT HEY EVERYBODY
THAT'S TALKED TO MAD POT THAT'S, YOU KNOW, ATTEMPTED AN EXPLOIT
AGAINST A JAVA PROCESS FROM AN ASN THAT IS REALLY TINY, THAT
DOESN'T USUALLY TALK TO US THAT, YOU KNOW, DOT, DOT, DOT AND SO
ON AND SO FORTH. AND EACH OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT WE ADD TO
OUR DETECTIONS ACTUALLY MAKE OUR DETECTIONS FASTER, THE MORE
SPECIFIC THAT WE GO. AND SO WE'RE REFRESHING ALL OF THESE
DATA SETS CONTINUALLY. RIGHT. MACHINE SPEED SO THAT WE CAN
KEEP UP WITH THE REAL INTERACTIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING
IN THIS VERY DYNAMIC NETWORK SPACE. SO TO GIVE A SENSE OF THE
SCOPE, WE ARE REVIEWING OVER 360 TRILLION TELEMETRY EVENTS PER
DAY, WHICH IS LIKE A MIND BOGGLINGLY LARGE NUMBER. THAT'S
OVER 4 BILLION EVENTS PER SECOND. YOU KNOW, A SNAP OF A
FINGER. AND FROM THIS WE'RE CONTINUALLY GENERATING ACTIVE
MITIGATIONS ACROSS THE NETWORK LAYER AND THE SERVICE DATA AND
CONTROL PLANE THAT ARE BEING PUSHED OUT EVERY THREE MINUTES,
RIGHT, TO DISRUPT THREAT CAMPAIGNS ALL THE TIME. SO IT
TAKES A LOT OF ENGINEERING SMARTS TO GENERATE THAT EFFECT.
BUT WHAT DOES IT REALLY DO FOR CUSTOMERS? ONE WE STOP MALWARE
INFECTION ATTEMPTS ON EC2 OVER 4 MILLION OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
WE STOP THE EXPLOIT ATTACKS THAT WE SEE IN MAD POT, HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF ATTACKS THAT WE'RE SEEING EVERY DAY NEVER REACH AN
EC2 WORKLOAD. WE DISRUPT BOTNETS, WHICH PREVENTING
INBOUND AND OUTBOUND DDOS ATTACKS AND PROPAGATION OF
MALWARE AND VULNERABILITY SCANNING. AND WE PROTECT
CREDENTIALS. WE ACTUALLY MAKE IT ABOUT 30 TIMES HARDER FOR
OPPORTUNISTIC THREAT ACTORS TO FIND ACCIDENTALLY EXPOSED
CREDENTIALS. BLOCK OVER 150 MILLION REQUESTS PER DAY FOR ALL
CUSTOMERS. SO A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE SHARED WITH
YOU HERE TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE YOU STICKING THROUGH WITH US AND
YOUR INTEREST IN THE TOPIC AS OUR OUR BIG WRAP UP. YOU KNOW,
WE INVEST REALLY HEAVILY IN THESE TELEMETRY AND SENSORS
BECAUSE SECURITY IS PART OF RELIABILITY, RIGHT? WE WANT
CUSTOMER OPERATIONS TO GO AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE. RIGHT. SO
THAT MEANS PROACTIVELY IDENTIFYING THREATS THAT COULD
BE DISRUPTIVE TO YOUR OPERATIONS. AND THEN TURNING
THESE OBSERVATIONS INTO INTELLIGENCE AT GLOBAL SCALE. IT
REALLY REQUIRES DATA SCIENCE, RIGHT. WE NEED TO SCALE VIA
AUTOMATION. AND AUTOMATION REQUIRES REALLY POWERFUL MODELS
THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE BOTH PRECISE AND FAST. WE REALLY
ARE KEENLY INTERESTED IN INTELLIGENCE, BECAUSE IT'S ONLY
AS GOOD AS THE ACTIONS THAT FOLLOW IT. RIGHT. AND SO WE
CHOOSE TO DISRUPT THREAT ACTIVITY AND MAKE THEIR
OPERATIONS MORE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY. AND THEN FINALLY, WE
TALK ABOUT THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL A LOT AT
AWS. WE ALSO HAVE SHARED OUTCOMES, RIGHT? WE'RE SUPER
DEEPLY INVESTED IN SUPPORTING CUSTOMER OPERATIONS. AND SO BY
BUILDING THESE COMPLIMENTARY CONTROLS AT THE AWS
INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER, ALLOWING YOU TO FOCUS ON YOUR UNIQUE
SECURITY CONTROLS THAT ARE USEFUL FOR YOUR APPLICATIONS AND
YOUR USERS AND CUSTOMERS TOGETHER, THIS ACTUALLY MAKES
THE INTERNET SAFER FOR EVERYONE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR
TIME AND ATTENTION TODAY. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENCE. THANK
YOU FOR COMING TO RE:INFORCE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU
IN THE FUTURE.
