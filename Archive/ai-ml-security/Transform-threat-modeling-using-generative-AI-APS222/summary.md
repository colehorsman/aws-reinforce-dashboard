## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session, presented by Tejas (Security Specialist Solution Architect) and Himanshu (CISO at TED), focuses on transforming threat modeling using generative AI. The session explores how organizations can improve security team efficiency and take more proactive steps in threat management through modern approaches to threat modeling.

The presenters discuss various security challenges, including the complexity of correlating multiple security controls with business risk appetite, and demonstrate this through a detailed example of an attack chain involving S3 buckets, containers, and Lambda functions. They explain how traditional threat modeling frameworks like STRIDE and DREAD help quantify risks, but highlight the challenges of scaling these approaches across multiple applications and microservices.

The session culminates with Himanshu presenting their solution called "Thread Shield," an AI-powered threat modeling platform built on AWS Bedrock. This platform has demonstrated significant improvements in their organization, including 30% reduction in threat modeling time, 30% faster review times, and 25% reduction in security findings. The solution helps teams predict potential threats before product development and enables more confident code deployment.

## Key Points
- Traditional security controls alone cannot identify risk levels without business context correlation
- Threat modeling helps identify risks before they materialize in production
- Multiple frameworks (STRIDE, PASTA, ATT&CK, DREAD) exist for threat modeling with different approaches
- Thread Shield platform uses AWS Bedrock and generative AI to automate threat modeling
- The solution addresses challenges of skill gaps and cross-team collaboration
- Demonstrated 30% reduction in threat modeling time across 40+ microservices
- Platform provides results in plain English, making it accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- Helps predict security issues before product development begins
- Integrates with product review documents (PRDs) and architecture diagrams
- Provides comprehensive threat analysis including attack trees and mitigation strategies

## Technical Details
- Built on AWS Bedrock using various LLM models (Claude, DeepSea)
- Utilizes open-source Light LLM for governance and role-based access control
- Integrates with multiple AWS security services (Inspector, Security Hub, Access Analyzer)
- Supports analysis of various input types: PRDs, architecture diagrams, conference notes, Slack threads
- Generates DREAD scores automatically based on input analysis
- Creates visual attack trees for threat visualization
- Supports microservices architecture running on AWS EC2 and containers
- Implements automated parsing and analysis of product documentation
- Provides integration with existing security controls and scanning tools
- Generates mitigation recommendations based on identified threats

Good afternoon everyone. OK. Seems like everyone had a lunch. OK, let's do one thing. Why don't you guys just raise your hand like this? Just is it, yeah, that's fine. Just a little bit more, yeah. Feels good, right, when the blood flows through. Yeah. Great. OK. Uh, I would like to start this session by thanking you all, taking out your time. Time is a valuable asset, especially when we are dealing with threats. We are always in constant battle improving meantime to respond remediation. But what if we can Improve uh security team's burnout time by taking more proactive steps. So today we'll be discussing about that. Um, my name is Tejas. I'm a security specialist solution architect, and along with me very well known name in the cybersecurity community. Uh, Himanshu will be joining you on In introduce yourself. Hello, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Himansu. I'm a chief information security officer at TED and a founding team member. Over to you. Thanks, thanks, Himanshu. So We'll be diving deep today on How we can achieve an actionable impact using the threat modeling. We'll be diving deep into some of the risk management techniques, pros and cons of that. And then Himan will help us walk us through how they have modernized their security operations, adopted culture of security, and Scale the threat modeling using generative AI. It's a really cool demo that, you know, Himanchu has. I'm really looking forward to see that. So before we dive deep, Let's clear some of the nuance around threat modeling. So as a centralized security team, we invest heavily on various different security controls. First party code vulnerability, SAAS, third party code vulnerability scanning like software composition analysis, then we have, uh, you know, uh, SOM scanning. Then we also have the posted management scannings as well like at the cloud at the OS, at the, you know, application level. But still, when we read those findings, even though it has those severity level, we cannot identify the risk level because at the business risk appetite is different. So we have to correlate a threat. And the threats for every business is different. You might be correlating with the insider threat or an external one. And the risk quantification will differ. The type of a threat that you are comparing. You also have to respond to the threat accordingly because some of the threat intent. And the impact will be also differing with each other. So usually as a security team, what we do, we identify all the attack surface that we get it from various different security scanners or the VAPT reports and then from our knowledge base, from the business risk appetite, we create a threat scenarios. We identify whether someone can do east west traffic, uh, lateral movement, someone can do initial exploit or do a CNC communication. Let's look at an example. So here we have an application. Uh, it's an application where you upload the S3, uh, file into S3 bucket. It needs S3 access. So what we are going to do is we'll be exploring this application. There are. There's one more microservice running along with it. Both are running on EC2 in a container, self-managed EC2 instance. And uh as a threat actor or as a red team, we identified this attack surface, we created the exploit. Now this is the exploit payload which will do the remote code execution attack. We are adding the CLI and we are sending it as a content type header. HTTP has a multiple headers. We are sending it as a content type header, as a normal HTTPS request. So when we run this Python script with the parameters of the target and the CLI we want to execute, we get an access. So now we have an initial patient 0 we have access to. The next thing we identify what permissions do we have? The container is having the additional permission for creating the lambda function. So now, we created a malicious lambda function, which will download a malicious payload, CNC communication and do a lateral movement between two containers. So now the 2nd container was having secrets in the code. That's how a threat actor is able to go to the database and exfiltrate the data. The reason why a threat actor is able to do this because there are a series of various different attack surfaces are correlating with each other. If you even disable one of them, threat actor is not able to execute their entire kill chain. So for example, The vulnerabilities in the Apache Common libraries or The privileges additional which was allowing a actor to create a lambda function. Uh, or The I am roll attached to the. Should be attached to the container instead of the node itself. And some of the posture management side, for example, containers should have the read-only file system or it should have harder credential. Now these details you identify from AWS uh incident response services like inspector, security hub, access analyzer. But how can we identify the risk before even the risk materialized? Before even it goes to the production. That's where the threat modeling helps. So there are various different threat modeling frameworks, like stride, pasta, Ete tree, Dread. For example, stride helps us quantify the risk and apply the mitigation control. Against application functionality, whereas a dread helps us quantify the risk, provide the numbering mechanism against the threat, and in each provide the same goal, you know, to quantify the risk can help us mitigate the risk. So usually what we do We identify various controls that we have. We identify what are the gaps today we have, not just technical gaps, but also operational people and process as well. And then think of the scenario. These are the predictive scenario based on our experience as analyst experience. And if the scenario, like we have seen in the demo, if it's bypassing all the vulnerabilities, we give the higher score. In this case of dread. And what do we do about it? So if the score is higher, we usually try to first mitigate as much as possible. So for example, patch the vulnerability, right? Or make sure that root file system is read only so no one downloads and run any arbitrary code over there. Um, and then add additional layer of protection. Like AWSA for the North South traffic protection. Make sure that you have deep packet inspection in network firewall, right? For the outbound protection where a threat actor was downloading those uh malicious payload in the container. No matter whether it's a preventive control, protective detection response. Imagine that you have to do this for every application. All the microservices and the functionality map to it. You have to predict such scenarios, identify those gaps according to your business risk appetite, and then. Identify the real 5 or 10 things that your team needs to be doing today. Uh, now we really need to scale this operation and that's where, uh, I would like to invite Himanshu over here to take us through how they have developed an application using a generative AI to do a threat modeling. Yeah, thank you, Jesus. Cool. Um, so I'll quickly talk about what my company does. So if you think about India, India has a population problem. There are 1.4 billion people in India. Now solving for each of them is nearly impossible. You can't build a product that caters to all the population of India. So what we have done at credit is we are focusing on top 5%, which is close to 60 to 70 million people, but these are the set of people who have credit score, who have some level of finance, who have money to spend, who have money to invest, so we are trying to sort of build a credit worthy and trustworthy community. Uh, using our company, um, we are currently one of the largest fintech based out of India, and we have around 150 million monthly transiting users in our platform. Going ahead When we think about that model as you know the spoke about, there are a lot of challenges at the scale, and you're trying to solve for threat modeling at the scale. Now what are these challenges? When you think about threat modeling, it comes much early, even before you have built a product. Largely it comes during the design phase where things are very ambiguous. You're not aware about what needs to be solved, how do you really think about, uh, that modeling as such. So what What you need, need to think about is basically, you know, when you think about the threat modeling from a product point of view, there are a lot of people involved, right? There are technology people involved there are product people involved, there are legal involved, there are multiple teams involved, right? So bringing everyone to a single platform is one of the challenge. Second is around the skill gap challenge, right? So not everyone understands threat. Now making everyone understand threat impact risk is one of the other challenges where you know not everyone would be able to visualize or understand the impact on, you know what really threat means in the context of the discussion being done or the product being developed, right? And the attack surface are significantly growing every day. We don't know what we're dealing with right? and. If you think about threat modeling, I think there are a lot of frameworks. Now each of frameworks give you a different kind of results. It's very difficult to consolidate all of these little single lapo or single framework. And that's what we are doing. Uh, we have built Tread Shield. It's an AI powered 3 model platform. It's an in-house platform right now. Um, so what it does is basically it helps you predict all sort of threat modeling much before the developer has started to build a product or even. The product people are still in a hypothesis phase or even the legal team is sort of, you know, looking, looking at what could be the risk from uh launching a 0 to 1 product, right? Uh, second is obviously for injuring people. Uh, the challenges are again very big, you know, much before the code has been written, developers don't know what really to focus on. And again for security people it's very challenging to say or convince engineering team on what really needs to be focused on, right? So challenges are very, very diverse and it's very difficult to cater to all the, uh, all set of audience and hence this thread shield actually helps, uh, cater to all the audience that is possibly looking at a 0 to 1 product or a growth product. Right, and again, like if you think about threat as such, there is obviously risk impact severity, there are a bunch of jargons. It's nearly impossible to explain all the technology and non-tech folk about the security risk that could arise from launching a product, right? So threads actually gives a consolidated view about all the, all the risk or all the severity, uh, in the product that is being developed. Uh, and last but not least is around the validation. Once you're identified all the threats, how do you really validate? How do you basically, you know, prioritize things or how do you say that, uh, these are the things that you really need to focus on and fix, right? So threads it actually helps you do all of these. Um, Now thinking about impact, so once we have built this product and once we have moved into products and what we have understood right now, the impact is used, uh, and again like when you think about impact, uh, we have developed this and we have rolled out to 40+ services. These are all microservices hosted on AWS and we have seen around 30% reduction in time to basically you do 3 modeling across these 40+ services. Right, so again, looking at the second metric, there are 30% faster review times. Earlier we used to spend a lot of times in, you know, doing a lot of to and fro with work people explaining them what we really need, and they're explaining us how we need to think about the entire customer journey. So this time has reduced. Uh, there has been a significant reduce of around 25% on security findings, but what really happens is you still we are able to predict what can go wrong much before the product is being developed. And last but not least, all the team can confidently ship their product or their code into the production with by using thread shield, right? So. Now talking about the architecture, I have put a very simple architecture here. Now all of these is powered on AWS. Going from right side extreme right, we have like a underlying large language models. It could be cloud, it could be deep sea or anything that is supported by AWS bedrock. So Tread shield is basically powered entirely by AWS bedrock, and this is a power like we don't have to really go out of the cloud to scale or build. Anything out, right? And on top of it we have use open source light LLM. This is mostly for governance layer and roll based access control. And that's where 3 shield is on the extreme left where everything is built on top of AWS bedrock and light LLM underlying using cloud and Desek. I have a demo here. Uh, once the demo is done, I'll be standing outside, maybe we can talk more. Uh, I'll go ahead and play the demo. So I'll walk you through the demo here. So what you do is you start your assessment. Here you enter any of your, I've just taken a dummy project name here. So you talk about a project, what your project is about. You upload a PRD PRD is your product review document. So once you upload your PRD, you can give more context. It could be a conference, it could be a slack thread, or you can also upload your architecture diagram. Once you have done this, you can give basic details about what you're really going to do an assessment about, right? What type of application is being, you know, uh, uh, developed, and what sort of authentication mechanism you are using. So after feeding all this basic information, thread shield in the back goes, runs a bunch of racks, does all sort of automations. Gets full context of your PRD, parses it, and then based on that, it generates your entire set model attack surface using a. So once you look at all this, once the threat model has been attacked has been reed, you will have a complete dread score which just spoke about. And then once the score is developed, you will have all the mitigation. That thread can provide you. So over here, if you see this is a result of uh a simple PRD you can think about this from a stride perspective. These are all the results for stride. So you can look at and you can focus on what really are the problems with the PRD that was developed or that was, you know, uploaded to Thread shield, and you can go through each of them. These are like plain English. You don't need to really be a hardcore technical person and anyone can go and understand what really is. Uh, what is the impact, what is the risk, and what really needs to be focused? Next you have attack tree. Here, based on whatever threats have been identified. You can other AI you will generate attack trees and based on that you can go look at the attack tree and basically focus on specific things that you really need to prioritize. Right, so here again like you'll see a basic understanding of what the attack is. After that we give a score. Here in context of score, basically whatever was identified, we score all of them so that it's easy for us to prioritize what really needs to be looked upon even before the product has gone live, right? So all sorts of issues on the extreme right you'll see all sort of scores and then you'll see a dis distribution across, uh, all sort of identified issues, right? And last year mitigation. Once the issue has been identified a score has been given, how do you really mitigate? I mean these are the mitigation steps which. Developer or tech team can basically go understand, read through it, and basically apply best practices or apply all the mitigation strategies. Once you go back, you have all the historic report. Whenever you do basically an assessment, you'll have a historic report of whatever the PRD was uploaded or whatever the assessment was done. Here's you'll see a clear. Uh, view of our entire report in a single pane where you'll have a historic identification or understanding of what really had gone wrong in the product and there's a complete, uh, audit log of what has gone wrong in previously and what has been fixed and how things can right? so this is not point in time. This can always be ongoing like they just said earlier. Right, and you can generate a report, and this report can be shared with your auditors, it can be shared with our product team, it can be shared with your legal team. Uh, even if you're doing like a third party assessment, maybe you can use this report to say with your third party supply chain. And here we are giving a like a system where you can, you know, if you don't want to look into the report, you can directly query here in context of the report, for example, what are the opportunity heads, and then you'll get to understand all the issues that were identified. And this is like a final dashboard where you will have the entire overview of your entire organization, uh, re modeling that has been conducted on the thread steel platform. So this is, this is the demo? Uh, 3 CD is coming soon. We are in the last days of sort of releasing this product. Uh, so expect it to go live. It will be open source product. Again, like I said, build on top of AWS. But for now, if you want to play around, uh, we have Thread Cooser and Tread model using AWS Bedrock. These are again open source products on AWS, uh, GitHub links. You can scan the QR code and then possibly once we go live with Tread so, we'll make some announcement on LinkedIn or social media. Uh, that's all from our side. Yeah, thanks to you. Thanks so much so that was really great demo. So, uh, if you guys have any feedback, you wanted to, you know, talk to us, understand, uh, if you want to build something like that, feel free to, you know, hold us over here. We will be, you know, here nearby, um, but yeah, please give us the feedback, uh, if you feel. Uh, this is good or any additional details that you need. Thank you. I do have my, I do have my head of infrastructure at AL labs, uh, standing there in the corner. Yeah, may feel free to speak with him. Uh, he's waving hand there. So will you downstairs. Uh, you can connect with us post this session. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
