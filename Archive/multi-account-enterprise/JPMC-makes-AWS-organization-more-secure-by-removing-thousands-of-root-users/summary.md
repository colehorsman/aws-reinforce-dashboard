## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session, presented by AWS representatives and JPMC, focuses on AWS's new Centralized Root Access feature launched in November 2024. The presentation addresses the historical challenges of managing root user credentials across large AWS organizations, particularly in regulated environments like banking, where hundreds of accounts require secure credential management and rotation.

The session explores how traditional root user management has been a significant operational burden, requiring manual processes, multiple personnel involvement, and middle-of-the-night change windows. The speakers discuss how managing root credentials across numerous accounts has led to weeks of engineering effort spent on non-strategic work, complicated audit processes, and security risks associated with standing credentials.

The presentation highlights how Centralized Root Access transforms root credential management by eliminating standing credentials, implementing short-lived sessions, and providing comprehensive audit trails. JPMC's implementation demonstrates how this feature has significantly improved their security posture and operational efficiency across their thousands of AWS accounts, reducing manual effort while maintaining strict security controls.

Awesome, um, just kind of quick show of hands, how many of you have ever needed the root user to do something urgent in the AWS account? Alright, I feel you. All right, you can, uh, keep them up if you ever enjoyed the process of two people being on call, someone digging an MFA token out of a safe, uh, doing a change window at 2 a.m. because you cannot touch your production environment during the day, all that sort of stuff, um, yeah, uh, difficult problem a lot of people experience all the time. Um, so yeah, imagine you're not doing that only once a year, uh, you're doing that probably a few times a quarter, maybe hundreds of times across hundreds of accounts, uh, more than you could fit on a single screen, um. So yeah, today we're going to tell you a story about how can you make all that go away. Alright, so in this talk we're going to talk about uh one of the very first identities which is the AWS root user, um, and why it could become actually a real headache, uh, when you run, uh, a lot of accounts, um, and, um, and, and adding on top of that a new AWS capability called centralized route access, uh, that changes really the game here, um, so I'll cover the background, the mechanics, and then James will share what his team. Uh, put, uh, uh, how they put this feature to work in their highly regulated bank. Um, so just kind of why we talk about why root credentials, how centralized root access could help with this, uh, and then we're gonna hear the bits about JPMC and how, uh, they went from discovery to automating the whole process, uh, and we'll finish with a handful of best practices. So I'm just going to start with a little bit of a timeline um so cast your mind to 2006 where AWS had a single uh root user uh and that was the only way in uh there was a single account model single root user to get into your account and it was pretty simple if risky, uh, because that single user had access to everything it could do everything, um, fast forward to 2011 we've introduced AWS identity and access management IAM. And when I arrives now you could create users you could create roles, attach policies and follow least privilege, um, and then now root gets pushed out to being a break class only model, uh, or a user. Um, jump to 2017, customers are running now hundreds of accounts running in isolation, um, for different purposes, billing, blast radius, and that's where AWS organization launches to help with that, uh, giving us the management account structure, uh, with various organizational units and member accounts under that organization unit and also controls like service control policies to govern your accounts, um. Then the problem here is still that every time you spin up a member account it still came with a root user um and that root user um just kind of as the more you create the more the problem uh keeps growing. That now that brings us to November 2024, uh, where last year we introduced centralized route access. Uh, from that day forward any new member account that gets created within your AWS organization, uh, comes without a root password, no access keys, and you have the ability to do the same for existing accounts where you could delete these credentials at the moment you enable the feature, um. So this changes kind of the game from being a long standing long term credential to a short term credential with an on demand capability offered through this feature and that's essentially kind of the quick backdrop of what we're going to cover today. So first for anybody that's not familiar with AWS organizations, uh, here's just kind of a quick primer, um, at the top you've got a management account, uh, think of it as it's your mission control, uh, under that you create member accounts and group them in different organizational units, um, and map them to the various teams and environments, um, and then. All spent kind of rolls into consolidated billing so finance could see a single invoice, uh, and then you could apply security, uh, using service control policies that could deny or allow specific AWS APIs and help you do that before even I am evaluates permissions, uh, and then from there you could organize things, run shared services, logging, networking, CICD in their own accounts, um, and, and do administration that way. Um, so keep that structure in mind as it's kind of important for how we're gonna talk about centralized route access and how it directly maps to that. So here's a view um uh of an AWS organization uh we're gonna put some credentials on that diagram so you've got your one management account uh you might have several OUs we're just gonna put one here and inside that OU you've got dozens of member accounts, um. Every one of those member accounts still carries a root password, a root credential and possibly uh protected with MFA as the best practice, um, probably you have policies or procedures to rotate that on schedule, um, but the problem here that each rotation could mean a change ticket, uh, or a middle of the night change window. And again like this is just kind of simplified view of an AWS organization probably for a larger institution you could have that across hundreds of uh accounts uh and that could get a really um uh a big uh uh operational burden on you. So when I say operational burden, how heavy is that? Um, so for example like, uh, a lot of our large customers could take, uh, told us they could take from several minutes of human intervention, um, um, every time they want to touch root, um, for example, procedures include unlocking a safe, um, or, or, uh, logging in through, uh, a system rotating that password, updating the vault, keeping records of that closing the tickets. Um, and then that gets kind of, uh, multiplied as you look over multiple or hundreds of accounts, um, and that works out to kind of weeks, uh, every time or every quarter or engineering effort that's possibly wasted, uh, on non-strategic work. And then the problem that uh adds to this is also when audit season arrives um you've got auditors asking two simple questions that sometimes hard to answer which is uh could root be used and if it could be used, how is it protected then you've got your operation teams kind of scrambling to. You know, um, go through vault exports, changed records, uh, clout trail logs, uh just to prove that nothing happened or at least like it was all safe. Also we've had service control policies so Root was not really left unprotected so long before this feature that we're gonna talk about, uh, uh, we had many customers use um service control policies. Service control policies are a type of organization policy that help you manage permissions in your AWBS organization. Um, for example, like this service control policy presented here, it, it's, it denies every EC2 API call when uh the principal is root. Um, I think it works, um, it, uh, but you cannot touch, cannot touch EC2, but it's very blunt, uh, and if you genuinely need to root for an emergency access, um, first you would probably have to move your AWS account or that specific account from your AWS organization or relax that policy to do your, um, the job that you need to do and remember to undo all that once it's done. Um, so effectively, yes, it's protected, but um it it feels a little bit manual and then some operational attacks there. So, um, root still exists for rare actions, um, for example, um, recovering a locked S3 bucket, uh, you need that for root, uh, SQSQs or enabling IM access for billing, for example, um, but those events are rare and far in between, um, and yet every account carries a password and an MFA that still needs to be protected, um, so again root is powerful, uh, there's no argument there. Uh, but managing hundreds of these route passwords, uh, MFA tokens, and storing them and protecting them is not strategic work. Um, also it feels like, uh, manual work at times, and our goal here with launching this feature was, uh, zero standing credentials, um, and transition that to more like short-lived fully logged credentials and only used for rare exceptions. So what we built, so to address this problem, um, um, and reduce the operation of burden, we launched centralized route access in November 2024. Um, you turn on centralized route access in the management account or delegated admin account, uh, at one time for that organization and once enabled, the first thing. Uh, that you get is basically an inventory to see, uh, uh, what's the state of the credentials in your AWS organization, which account has a root password, has MFA attached or doesn't have MFA attached. There any signing certificates or access keys attached to these root users and so on. Uh, and then one second you could choose to, um, to delete these credentials all together, um, and then, uh, all these actions of course like once you delete these credentials get captured in cloud trail, so you've got all the traceability and audit that you need, uh, for any audit requirements that you need to satisfy. And then, um, uh, when new member accounts get created in your AWS organization, as I mentioned earlier in the talk is, uh, they would not have any credentials altogether they will come without any credentials, so no passwords, no access keys, um, and then third, when you, um. Uh, essentially when, when you have any need for, um, performing any sensitive actions, for example, like you have an S3 bucket, uh, or an SQ SQ policy that you need to, um, uh, perform, uh, you would use your management account or delegated administrator account. I request a short term lid session that's tied to a single member account uh that expires by default within 15 minutes and that gets fully logged all the way through, um. And then all that is also available um in the console through APIs and through automation um so you could basically integrate that with your ticketing system um and you know automate all things related to kind of the discovery of these credentials whether you wanna audit their state, the clean up which is removal of that or even, uh, adding, um uh um requesting any of these short term sessions. The benefit you get of all of this as well like your security teams get this auditability feature as well so they could monitor the state of these credentials and tools like whether it's in the IM console things like trust or advisor as well where you could get reporting on that. So here's a quick checklist, uh, that we recommend. Uh first, delete any uh standing route passwords or access keys in your member accounts. Second, keep them from coming back by uh leaving kind of guard rails on, for example, these SEPs that block long lived root credentials or their usage. Third, when you truly need root, only do it from the management account. Uh, using a short-lived, uh, session, um, and, and again like access to your management account ideally would be protected by MFA and that could be fully logged as well. And then 4th, uh, keep an eye on that posture, right? Like you've got Treor advisor will show you greens when you're clear. And cloud trail uh records, uh, for any of these, um, um, kind of actions that you take, um, and finally protect continue to protect uh your management account with root, um, and reserve it only strictly for any break glass scenarios. Um, and that sets this chase. So James now, uh, will show how JPMorgan Chase kind of centralized their root access uh across their multiple AWS organizations and, um, and reduce the huge amount of work. So James, off to you. Thank you, Gen. So just a quick recap of JPMorgan Chase's journey into cloud, um, so we've had the honor of presenting it reinforced before and then our CIO Laurie Beer presented about our cloud journey at reinvent last year, um, as covered in both presentations, AWS footprint for JPMorgan is thousands of accounts running trillions of payments annually. Right, we're constantly partnering with solutions from uh AWS and other cloud providers to try to innovate on security in the cloud and make it best practice for our organizations and the financial industry as a whole. So as Khaled said, root accounts are secure. We don't want to say that centralized root management is, you know, was necessary to make it secure. It's just an improvement up from what was already there. You still have a 64 character randomly generated password, and as you heard in the keynote, it's now enforcing MFA across all of accounts. But if you're in a large organization such as ourselves, it becomes very difficult to manage that, right? It requires multiple people, multiple man hours to um improve the security. Over it and or improve the manageability of the security and this process allowed us to simplify that greatly um as I said it's generally best practice in an industry as you vault your credentials in an enterprise grade vault with an enterprise grade MFA that usually you have a separation of duties that that is a different organization from the individuals who manage your cloud. And it requires a rigorous process to keep it up to date. Typically you want to make sure that for, you know, high security workloads you want this MFA and you want this root credential maybe vaulted ahead of time just in case you needed an emergency which takes, uh, multiple man hours. So what centralized route management does is that it allows you to use IAM, right? So you get a, I would encourage all of you, you get a benefit immediately by turning this on where you don't make the problem space any bigger for yourself, but you haven't introduced any risk either because you can always go and generate the root credential should you need it, but as we'll go through in the presentation for the most common use cases, you may not actually need the root credential. Right, this allows you to increase the time to market for providing new AWS accounts for your sensitive workloads because you no longer have to worry about vaulting that root credential. Um, also it adds security in that it does remove the login profile, so even if an attacker figures out your email address, they have no opportunity to ask for the password to be reset once the login profile is not there. And I do want to encourage that this allows all your existing processes that you may have built in your organization to continue to function should you have a root credential, so it's really, it's a warm standby or or warm cut over process. It's not like you have to change how you do root today just to get the benefits of the service. So the most common actions are wizards now, as, as Khaled talked about, you know, the most common things that typically people see in development accounts is is that a developer writes a bad S3 policy, locks themselves out of the bucket. Well, now the benefit of centralized root account management is not only do you have a wizard through the console, but even if you do it through the CLI, you get not only a short-lived token, which is, uh, whereas root you might have a longer session. That token is specifically scoped to specific API actions where that individual performing that action can only list the buckets, get the current bucket policy, and update the bucket policy. It allows um use of federated just in time roles or whatever your preferred method for privileged accesses to the cloud, which the key point there is unlike the root user where you may have to go to your enterprise vaults to find out who checked out the password, you can trace it back to employees who actually use the root credential in centralized route of management to figure out who actually did the clean up of that S3 bucket. It also allows you to do this safely without that long lived credential, so it's it's a big benefit to know that AWS is managing it so it's only 15 minutes for you to do your job and, and honestly the operations that you need to do, that's more than enough time to do what you need to do. The big advantage of this as well is you can start to automate things. So taking the S3 or the SQS example, if that's something that commonly happens in your development environments, you can switch from having a human being manage it to providing, say SSM automation documents that can assume route from the centralized account or delegate account to allow application teams to unlock their own bucket or their own SQS with a default policy. So you can federate that are larger. It also means you can safely federate supporting root operations to larger organizations, right? typically due to the pain of what the root user can do, organizations tend to keep root to single in sets of individuals or single groups. This allows more federation of solving those problems so we can either federate the responsibility well without increasing the risk. I did want to go through there are additional ways you can protect route that they've added on to with AWS, so. The nice thing is uh Khaled spoke about the SEPs and the RCPs. It is possible for you to build an SCP where you disable the root user but still allow centralized route access management to work. So this is an example from an AWS blog where you see that they're using the new condition key. AWS assumed route equals true. In this case it's sending it to null to say that I'm gonna block all actions from a root user unless it's assumed root credential. So that way you can if you want to and you don't need root for other solutions that are not there yet such as uh older billing statuses you can fully buy in to the centralized route management process without causing any additional risk for yourselves. So I did want to summarize um benefits for this like I can say for JP Morgan personally we spent hundreds of man hours over the lifespan of AWS to manage and vault these root accounts, and we've been able to help reduce that time significantly so that those individuals can spend more time doing improving our status on the cloud in other areas than doing simple password management within the organization. Um, the ability to scope and reduce these rods uh credentials are really powerful. Nowhaled talked about audit. It's very easy to now have a conversation with your auditor. They say, How are you protecting root for this particular account? Well, I don't need to because it no longer exists, right? Root is just not there, and I use the central wizard. And then also. It helps with also managing cost allocations on your enterprise vaults, right? You have a lot less credentials you need to vault and maintain, and there's a true life cycle that you can do with the root user should you need to build it where you can truly get just in time with even the root user itself. You build the user, give it a password, give it anFA, you go in, do what you need to do, and then using centralized route account management you can quickly delete that root user and lose. Up the risk associated with that root account. The email address stays so you don't have to worry about coming up with a new email address every time, but the credentials disappear so that you don't have to worry about keeping them vaulted or keeping the MFA on. I'd like to thank you all, uh. For your time, you know, if there are questions we can take them over on the side, but thanks again and as I said, if there's one thing I can say from our experience, right, this was one of the least risky and and simplest solutions for us to turn on and it improved our security status greatly and I encourage all companies to do it simply because it improves the overall health of the AWS ecosystem. Awesome thank you.
