## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session features Jon from AWS and Amos from SAP, focusing on how SAP implemented a scalable security blueprint across their massive AWS infrastructure of nearly 9,000 accounts. The presentation addresses the challenges of managing security at scale, including handling hundreds of daily alerts, processing massive log volumes, and maintaining security without sacrificing deployment speed.

The session details SAP's journey in creating their "Secure by Default" model, which enables them to manage security across their extensive AWS organization. As a global leader in business software with over 440,000 customers in 180+ countries, SAP needed to develop a solution that could handle their rapidly growing cloud infrastructure while maintaining consistent security standards and efficient threat detection.

The presentation outlines SAP's three-pillar approach to security, including centralized account management, lifecycle programs, and accountability models. Their solution involves extensive automation, cloud-native technologies, and a sophisticated deployment ring strategy for implementing new security controls without disrupting business operations. The approach allows SAP to maintain security at scale while ensuring rapid response to threats and consistent security posture across their organization.

## Full Transcript

Thank you for joining our session today at Reinforce, and today we talk security at scale. And I'm super pleased that we have today Amos from SAP with us, and we want to talk about how SAP achieved a security blueprint which scales on the massive volume of amounts of their accounts ASAP hosts on AWS. I had a CTO from another company coming to me and asked, Hey, I have security findings and they're lightening up like a Christmas tree. Can you help fix this? And I'm here at Reinforce and maybe some of you in the audience have the same picture. You get a lot of alerts. You maybe have different sources of your systems where you need to look for security findings. But we want that you look at your Christmas tree and you feel warm and secure, and that's why we want to explain to you today how you can solve this security patterns as well at massive scale. And when your cloud environment scales in the case of SAP, it's nearly at 9000 AWS accounts, you face the reality that you get 500 alerts maybe on a daily basis, so your security teams get a lot of information. And you need to enable your security teams to really hunt behind the threats which matter and even on a big scale of AWS environments this becomes more and more important. What we as well heard from different customers is massive log volumes. If you run thousands or maybe millions of lambda function EC2 instances, thousands of applications in the AWS cloud, you encounter a lot of log volumes, and what is important there is that you have near real-time log analysis still happening for you that your security team is informed. What we heard from other customers was when you have security tools which maybe you used before the cloud area that they could not be capable anymore to doing log analysis on. On a fast pace, so it took maybe hours or maybe the tools really stopped working on this massive volumes. So what we need to support you is as a customer that you need scalable solution for your systems. And time to market is one of the key capabilities. So what you cannot do as a company is that you slow down and maybe have statements like here, right? I need to move fast or stay secure. This is in the current environment not possible anymore. What we need, and this is what we from AWS stand for, is that we enable you that you can move fast and stay secure. Because the best feature your company is developing is not of any use if it creates a security hole in your posture. So what we enable you from AWS is even if you have a massive scaled AWS organization, if you need to be capable of looking into millions of log files on a minute hourly basis, that we make sure that you still can stay secure and be fast and deployed to production on minutes or hourly basis. And how we do this, you may have seen this slide before. We have the shared responsibility model. So we from AWS, we give you secure infrastructure. We make sure your AWS data centers are secure, and we give you services which scale to a massive amount, and we will hear some examples later on to you that you can host your applications in the AWS cloud. And as customers are responsible to deploying secure applications in the cloud. This means the application you deploy needs to be secure as well as the data you host on the AWS cloud. And I'm super happy that I'm joined today by SAP and Amos, who will introduce himself in a second, and SAP will explain how they went on this journey, how they created a secure by default framework to support their massive scale, and here I want to hand over to you. Thanks Jon for the great introduction. Hear about first of all about SAP. SAP got founded in 1972 and is a global leader in business software. We have over 100,000 employees across the globe and in addition, over 40,000 contractors as well. We also have over 440,000 customers in more than 180 countries across the globe. 77% of all world transaction revenue touches somehow on the SAP system. Very quick about myself, I'm based in Waldorf, Germany, which is also the headquarters of SAP. I'm a cybersecurity data governance lead in the SGSC Department of SAP. SGSC stands for SAP Global Security Cloud Compliance. I'm I'm experienced in designing secure and scalable AWS solutions such as the Secure by default model which I'm going to talk about in a minute, and I'm also an expert in automating security and compliance for large scale cloud systems such as the one we have with AWS in SAP. The challenge we faced. We have currently nearly 9000 accounts in AWS in our SAP environment and it's constantly, constantly growing all the time. Also the challenge was like to have an operational overhead which is increasingly significant when we are adding more and more accounts and more and more customers to our SAP AWS environment. We also need to ensure that we constantly secure all of our configurations across all AWS accounts across 9000 AWS accounts in our SAP AWS full organization. It's also important, and that was also a challenge for us to efficiently detect and respond to all kinds of security threats so that no one is left behind or we never like miss any kind of security event in our organization. 33 pillars here which are important to our secure by default model. We centrally manage all of our accounts in the fashion that we have it all in a like full organization way in our AWS environment. That also means like we need to make sure that we like split them up into different organizational units so that we can make sure that it's like well organized and we can make sure that our customers and our colleagues can feel secure and well maintained. It's also very important to have a good life cycle program in place. That means, for example, if an account is not being used for a certain time, it will be flagged as deleted or flagged as not being used and then deleted so that no account will be left unused and cannot be a potential threat for us. It's also very important to have a good accountability model in place, so it means that we always know who we need to reach out to in case of a security event or if for example an attacker tries to gain access and security event will get triggered, we know for example that we need to reach out to the security officer which is in the background in our database which is then being contacted in case of a security event. It's also very important that we have a technically responsible user that we need to reach out to in case, for example, the account is being unused. There's a specific need to reach out to them in case of a security event so that we always know who is accountable for that specific AWS. In this slide here you see the chart on the right hand side. You see like in October 2020 we had roughly about 2000 AWS accounts. Since then we were growing up to 9000 AWS accounts at the moment and it's growing every day as I'm talking to you. It's also very important to have a good like people process in place that means we need to secure development and a good secure operations team which can then act on if there's a security event occurring. It's also very important to have a central governance in place since I'm part of the data governance team. I can say it's very important to have something and oversight of all of the data governance processes within our AWS accounts. This also means that the process, which ultimately means like scale leads to automation, is very important to us so that we can meet our targets and our KPIs, not only for us but also for our customers of SAP. Also, the automation leads to consistency because since we were scaling that tremendously as you can see here, 2000 accounts in 2020 and now nearly 9000 accounts as of right now, we will not be able to do this without any automation because you cannot scale a security team as we scale with our accounts at the same time. Also, the technology is very important and I will come to that in a minute. You need to think more cloud native and you need to automate your security engineering as well as your security operations team. Also tools and platforms, as I was just saying like secure by default is a very important pillar in our organization that makes sure we inherit, for example, certain controls throughout the organization to make sure it's always well maintained and we and myself, we can just sleep better at night. Here you can see at the bottom we have a ton of security events as you was just stating it lights up like a Christmas tree. We have a ton of white noise going on in the organization as well of us know, like you get like hammered by security events, alert, logs, scans. You cannot keep up with that all the time. That means like you need to enrich your data, your processes, and make sure you tag and. your logs the right way so that this will ultimately lead to something like a secure by default model to a security operations team with automation and that your security operations team can really look at what's needed and what we really need to look at and not like hammered by logs, hammered by emails, and tons of like scans which are going on all the time. Here you can see our secure by default model and the automation we have in place. This means like here in the middle you see Orca Security, which has all of our like secure by default controls deployed in. This means like for example you have like an EC2 instance with let's say port 22 or 3389 open to the internet. It will be automatically detected by Oca security by our secure by default controls, and will be automatically remediated through the different security controls which we have in place. This is also continuously growing as we develop new secure by default controls. I will also counter that in the next slide where we can see how this is being done. As I said here in the middle, we have the security controls deployed. On the left hand side you see lambda. Lambda is also acting on like, for example, if port 22 is open, it will be automatically remediated and closed in your AWS account. So there's nothing needed, no action directly by any user. You can sleep well at night, even if, like, for example, some of your colleagues make a mistake in the security group which is attached to an AWSEC. On the left hand side at the bottom you can see the automated notification. So for example, if port 22 SSH is open, it will be remediated, closed directly. The user will get notified, Hey, you had some kind of like port open here, like port 22. This is not a good like best practice in our world, so it got closed. So please don't do this again. How we do that, we have like an SAP master data cloud database in there we have all of our users like. technically responsible users, how we call it an SAP and also security officer. These will get contacted by our master database where for example the user ID or the email address is being recorded and then it will be sent out via an automatic email or even a ticket will be created in the background if there's like a security threat in that account. You can see here on the left hand side on the top in the right rectangle, this is the AWS cloud where we are working in. In there you have our SAP AWS full organization and even in there you have our SGSC delegated amen. As I was stating, SGSC stands for SAP Global Security Cloud Compliance. This is the team I'm also working in. In that central account we have here, for example, 3 different pillars AWS Cloud trail, which is also inherited throughout the organization to make sure no attacker, no intruder can manipulate or tamper around with our cloud trail API logging. We also have Amazon Guard duty enabled through the organization. This means like when account will get created, you have directly Amazon Guard duty with the base protection with different other protections directly enabled with it so that you can feel secure right from the beginning. We also have our S3 bucket for all kinds of like audit logging and audit trails in there. So AWS Cloud trail sent it to a central bucket for all of our accounts within our SAP AWS full organization. This then leads to cribble. Cribble is our main cribble stream, our main way to our CM spluk environment. Which will then be recorded in there so that our colleagues, our detection team can use cases tailored on the different detections, and they can react directly on there. The users, SAP colleagues, customers can then directly go into the sunk system, see in there, see raw locks or even see the triggered events which are in there. And on the right hand side you see the AWS account users. They have access to AA Security to see, for example, if there was any kind of vulnerability in their account in AA security or directly see the alert which got sent via email, which I will also come in a minute and then look into Slan to see, for example, the raw event or if like for example in that account another event occurred to see what else was going on there. As I was stating, in our secure by default model, we often get asked like, hey, how do you develop new security controls without disrupting your business? We do that with different deployment rings here. Deployment ring means we have like for example here in deployment ring one. Our team is developing a new security control. So for example, another port which is known for let's say Bitcoin mining is out there in the public. We will develop a tailored new security control which will then be put into deploymenting one. So we have different departments within SAP. This means like for example. There is a team which knows like, hey, that Bitcoin mining port or that port is being used by another system of ours, so we want to make sure that none of these ports will be disrupting their business so they can opt in into deployment ring one to have an early feeling and give feedback to us with their test or canary accounts to make sure we get the right feedback from them or we can even talk to them directly and make sure nothing will be disrupted. This will go on for 2 weeks. After 2 additional weeks and there was feedback collected, we may change the control a bit here and there. We will target even a broader range of accounts, so non-production accounts normally. You can flag your account in the SAP master database for like deployment ring 1, and automatically you will get the deployment deployment ring 2, security controls directly to your account inherited by the organization. This will again go on for 2 additional weeks and then lead into deployment ring 3. In deployment ring 3, we target even a broader range of accounts to gather more feedback from colleagues or our account users and have this deployed primarily for pre-production accounts. After these two weeks, we will then target all production accounts, so all accounts, no matter what in our SAP AWS full organization and then deploy it like live to all accounts throughout the arc. Our cloud account management strategy. For us it's very important to have all AWS SAP accounts within our full organization. This gives us a lot of possibilities to match it in a central fashion and not just like go into every account again and need to like. Deploy stuff all over the place so we can inherit it through the Account master and then top down through the organization. It's also very important to have a very strict and enforced password policy that no one can set any kind of weak passwords or can do some crazy like 123 ABC password stuff with their account so we make sure that it's always secure directly from the beginning of the account creation or if a person will change their account password, it's always secure and enforced by that secure password policy. We also make sure that we have the MFA enforced for all account users. So if you don't have MFA activated for a user, you will not see anything. You will just get errors all over the place, no matter what you're trying to do unless you have MFA activated. We also make sure, as I was just stating that we have like API, audit and storage access logging applied to all accounts which cannot be deactivated, for example, with the way of cloud trail, how we are doing it and will be sent to a central bucket. With that we make sure even if an attacker got into one of your accounts, you will still get all the API. And storage access logs through the organization sent to our SAP SGSC delegated admin account. We also make sure that we collect these logs, as I was saying, centrally via our ribble and into our seam, which is plunk in our kind of way in SAP. We also make sure that we enforce like block listed ports and they're not exposed to the internet, as I was saying, port 22, for example, also 3389 like RDP or known ports which are used for potential Bitcoin mining. We also make sure that low block storage or storage bucket or snapshot can be made public. So for example, if you're trying to attach an EBS volume to your instance like EC2, you cannot do this when it's not like completely encrypted and will not be possible. Like in that kind of fashion, for an instance or even for a storage bucket, so if you try to make it like public, it will not be even possible to hit the save button in your AWS account and the same stands also for snapshots. It's very important, as I was saying, to have encrypted block storage. So if you try to have an unencrypted block storage, unencrypted bucket, you will not be able to even save that without getting an error message or it will directly change back with one of our secure by default controls. Our security baseline. Three pillars. It's important to have all accounts managed automatically within our SAP AWS organization. This makes it easier to react on potential security threats, to manage better our structure, organization structure within our SAP AWS accounts, and also makes it easier for the colleagues to react or switch to different accounts within our organization if needed. It's also important to centralize it on an enterprise grade as we are in such a large scale regardless of the business unit, so we don't differentiate between our departments of business units. We all have this in one big umbrella within our organization. And here, the third pillar we have different lines of businesses. They sometimes have different needs. For example, they want to secure their systems because of a special needs in a special way, so we talk to them directly to make sure we hear them, talk to them, and then maybe develop a tailored, secure by default controls just for their organization unit or for their department. But you cannot prioritize. You're way out of scale. As I was just showing like we had like 2020, we had 2000 accounts. Now we have like nearly 9000 accounts and growing every day. You can see here at the bottom the increased volume of security events above there like you have a lot of security events as was saying. Lights up like a Christmas tree for a lot of us. You have like alerts, logs, all different kinds of like maybe emails, maybe other things going around. So you need to enrich, put it in the right context, and also then prioritize the right way. This is helping us a lot with the help of AWS and also with the automation we have with some kind of our secure by default controls as well as cloud native tools which are provided from AWS directly. And this also then leads to like funnel it better to our security operations team so they can make sure they focus on the core business and don't have like all the stuff running around their heads increasing emails, increasing logs increasing tickets so they can really focus on what they need to. Here you can see it even better. The better you configure your landscape, the easier it gets to funnel the right like security events to the security operations team so that they can make sure they concentrate again on the right events. They don't like get disrupted by like some kind of like noise going around so you can make sure you configure. Your landscape the right way. It's also very important that you reconsider what kind of tooling and services you have in place so that they can provide the tools and services a higher value to your organization so that you can make sure you're secure, you can sleep better at night, our customers can sleep better at night, and even myself and the security operations team. How SAP is sending root user credentials. I got asked a lot like how do you deal with like root user credentials? We never like never ever hand out credentials, never to any user, never to any SAP customer, to any user, any employee, not even myself. I cannot see any of your root user accounts like even if you're like like screaming at me, shouting at me, I will never hand anything like that out because I don't even have access to it. The only thing is like we have a special team which only gets in there if there's like a special, special, special need. This normally never happens, even not 1%. So to make sure you handle your specific accounts or your root user the right way so that no one can even see your root user or can get in there. It's also very important that tasks are exclusively performed through IIM roles so that no one needs to jump into different accounts with different users so that you do this via IIM rolls, which is also the best practice and how we also do it in SAP. Security and compliance, it's also very important that you centrally manage and ensure strong security and ability, for example, that you know who's sitting behind every. SAP AWS account and you can make sure you always have a point of contact to reach out to in case of any kind of security event or any kind of attacker trying to manipulate your account or if the account is being unused for a specific period, you know who to reach out to and say, hey, maybe you don't need that account anymore. It could be a potential security threat for us. Maybe think about getting rid of it so that's. The security and a strong security and eligibility part of our security and compliance. I often ask a lot like how we are going to build up security expertise within SAP. It's very important that you do this on a weekly basis, how we do it, for example, with cloud security office hours. We host this on a weekly basis where everyone is welcome to join. For example, all of our colleagues can join our weekly security office hours, can interactively ask questions. We have also sometimes special cases, for example. If we have a special use case like a new guard duty protection plan which we're going to enable, we will interactively talk to them, get questions. You always know who to reach out to. I'm also part of that that weekly call, so you can also contact me, ping me directly on Teams, for example, and get direct feedback. That's also very important to talk directly to your users because if you do this like in a silo, you never know what the users are thinking, so it's always important to talk to them directly. What we also do is like we host security learning summits. It's important to do something like that. So for example, as I was just stating, you have a new guard duty protection plan which is going to be enabled. You train them, you let them know what you're going to plan. If there may be some kind of disruption, maybe they want to do it in a different way. So with that we host security learning summits. What we also do, and what I'm also personally a big fan of is like AWS Game Day. AWS Game Day is a gamification way of learning, for example, how an intruder can get into your AWS account or could potentially gain access and how you can make sure you got rid of the attacker and feel secure, sleep better at night again, and that's an AWS game day which we host on a regular basis in our SAP organization. As I was stating, the more cloud native, the easier it gets. It's very important to think cloud native, to adopt a cloud native mindset, to make sure you reconsider your toolstick. Maybe you can replace tools with a cloud native solution such as an AWS service to make sure you have always the best and cloud native tools in your organization and all of your AWS accounts. It's also important. To enable the organization and focus on the core business needs, as I was stating to funnel the security events and to make sure your security operations team, for example, can concentrate on the right events and don't have to like look around for a ton of backlog items through a ton of emails and make sure it's well organized and enabled throughout the organization. It's also important to use cloud native capabilities, for example, the organization units. I was stating we organize it in a way that for example the different departments of NSAP have different organization units. So if we need to deploy a specific secure by default control, we directly know which accounts we need to target on and can make sure we do this in a streamlined and central fashion with the help of organization units. It's also important to reconsider this tool stack as was stating, maybe you can replace stuff with a cloud native tool. Always challenge yourself, make sure you reconsider it because hackers, they don't care like. It's very important to reconsider your tools all the time and also continue your path to zero trust. Zero trust is very important. You have a strong identity like I am, as I was stating, MFA enabled by default or even a strong password policy for all your accounts to make sure you are secure by default and have a good. Like secure by default way and path to zero trust. These privileged access, for example, you don't hand out like admin access to all of the users. Maybe you have a user which only needs read only access. Why should you give them like the admin role, for example, which can be potentially disruptive or an attacker could gain access through that role to destroy some of your business or some of your accounts. It's also important to continuously monitor all of your accounts with the with the way we do it, for example, with the help of guard duty or other security tools to make sure you control your organization and monitor it continuously. And with that, I went to hand over again to Yahi. Thank you, Amos, and thanks for sharing your perspective on making security possible at scale. We want to zoom in now on guard duty, as I already said, Guard duty is one of the key tools they use to keep their system secure. And what I want to do now is I want to give you a small overview about guard duty, and then Amos will explain how SAP is using guard duty in detail. So God duty is our threat intelligence service and it works on a massive scale. It scans over the foundational data sources, let it be flow logs, DNS logs, or cloud trail event. We have as well AWS workload specific sources which I will talk about in a second. And all this information is then used for security analysis. We have an ML system in place. We have threat intelligence in place to alert you if something specifically is happening in your AWS accounts across your complete organization. And what you can do with this, we heard it multiple times that automation is essential, so you could use a bridge to automatically trigger remediations. You can pass it through to security hub to monitor your system and maybe do audits against your environment, or you can use Amazon Detective to future analyze certain findings. How this works under the hood, and I want to explain a bit about how the inner functionality of God duty and what we do with it. We have, for example, MA, and this is one of the big capabilities we have at AWS that we have billions of nodes and edges out on the internet which are scanning for malicious domains. And restoring these malicious domains in a big database and when one of your EC2 instances is then talking to some of these malicious domains, we alert you with our duty. We have a med pot in place which is a big honey pot on the internet where we simulate certain workloads. Let it be, for example, a scale database, an entry point, but as well we simulate them with some fake data, a complete database. Why we do this because we want to understand how bad actors work. We want to understand the behavior of bad actors on the internet. this into our threat detection service that you benefit from it and that we really can tell you about how bad actors in the internet act and that if it's maybe replicated in your environment you get. And it's made for massive scale. We heard it already from SAP. Another example we have with data is last year's Prime Day. Maybe you shopped on Prime Day. I did as well for my family, and what we have seen there is we monitored 6 trillion log events in about an hour, which is about 30% increase, and this underlines how core duty is capable of supporting your organization on a massive scale. I want to talk about a new feature we launched on reinvent. And this is called duty extended threat detection. As we heard already, for high scale, large scale companies, it's super important that the security operations team focus on the right topics. This extended threat detection, we give you now a critical alert. When something is happening on your environment, why critical? Because we have seen different signals from your behaviors in your log files, and we then can most probably say something really suspicious is going on. Your security team needs to look there. So I'll give you an example. So for example, we see that there is a compromised AW access key. Then this access key is used to log into an EC2 instance and then from this EC2 instance, a 3 bucket is encrypted or some files are copied out. So there with the sequence we learned for example from our madpod of bad actors, we can then say with high confidence, hey, here's something really severe going on. Please look at this. We have as well the AWS workload protection and some of them as well in use by SA. For example, we have certain S3 protections, for example, for malware where we scan for malware software in millions of your S3 pockets if you have them, or on volumes of EBS volumes. We have an EKS protection plan and if you have run hundreds or even thousands of EKS clusters, it produces a lot of log files. We are looking into these log files and if something specific is going on, what we think could be a threat, we alert you on this. As well as RDS protection for all your databases, when we see login attempts, which are maybe in 1 minute we got a brute force of 50 times someone tries to log in and one was successful, we alert you on this. And I think a very powerful thing is the runtime monitoring where you install an agent on an EC2 instance and then we really look on process processes in this EC2 instance if a process is doing something, but it should not be the case. So all this workload protection plans you can select based on the workload you have in your company, let it be E2 focus or lambda focused, and We get you covered there with God duty worker protections. And with this I want to hand over to Amos again and he explains how ACP is using God duty in detail. Thanks again Jorge. So I want to tell you how we are using Amazon Guard duty in our SAP landscape. Here on the right hand side you see like a finding. I know it's very small, but I can quickly explain what you're seeing here. On the top, you see like it was a potential credential compromise with an assumed admin role here. In one of our accounts and got indicated by the different actions with the Mor attack framework. You also see here the mapping of the Miter attack framework in the middle of the screen and also at the bottom you see the different tactics which Mitter triggered in that case. You also see here the different signals, the overview, for example, the finding ID, the finding type from guard duty, and also in which region it occurred and which account in this case a sample account since it's a sample. Alert generated. You also see if you would click on the resources what kind of resources were affected in that finding and in which account it occurred. So this makes sure you can directly act on or see if it may got remediated automatically by guard duty or by one of our secure by default controls to make sure you have the right guidance by AWS and also always the best practices by guard duty in place. Our Amazon Guard duty SAP security architecture. Amazon Guard duty is a central component, also part of our secure by default strategy, and with Amazon Guard duty we monitor all of our AWS environments for potential threats, and I was saying on the previous slide, it's directly within the account creation enabled and inherited through our SAP AWS for organization. This makes sure when an alert triggers it gets automatically in some cases remediated. For example, if a port is open, if an attacker tries to use some kind of like Bitcoin mining port, if there was a potential assumed role, or if there was an actual assumed role. Taken place in your account, guard duty will detect this, automatically remediate and alert via guard duty, and then also send this via cribble to our sea. We have tailored made detections or use cases for it which will then trigger. Like for example, ticket or send an automatic email to our users which are stored in that SAP master cloud database. It's also integrated with our SAP security operations team, so the security operations team gets them automatically the best and like well designed. Security events via guard duty and being sent via email triggered by also a ticket and also sees the severity in guard duty as well as via email and in their like different tickets. It's also important with guard duty that it's like scalable on. over it for us this is very important because we cannot deploy it on every single account by hand. It's inherited through the organization and also very scalable and can also fit our needs of such a large organization as we have in SAP AWS. This slide here, I know it's very small, but I will tell you what we see here. This is a screenshot I took from one of the emails I got in a sample alert again from our guard duty extended threat detection, which is also directly inherited through our organization, which also is in our like Amazon guard duty plan, and you can see here on the top left the alert name, for example. This was an AWS GD guard duty extended threat detection alert, which has also like the alert link to it. He highlighted as blue on the left hand side. You can click to it. It will bring you to the Slum system site where you can see it like also like in a like centralized fashion. Or if you want to see it like in a raw log, you can also click on view results in Slu. It Also show you in that same account the different alerts which have been occurred and also like you can see the raw log events if you want to follow up or talk to the detection team or even to myself about that alert. This will also be included into the ticket which will be sent to the user so you get not only an email but you also get the ticket with. Down below you see like the description as you were saying on the previous slide in the finding ID you see the different miter attack techniques which have been triggered, so you also see this here, for example, for that. 111222333 sample account here in that case you see the different micro attack techniques which have been used and then have been triggered by that event so that you can make sure you follow up, you Google that mitor attack tactic framework, and you have always the latest and greatest attack technique framework applied in that guard duty event as well as listed in. And with that, I want to hand over again for the round up summary to you. Thank you, Amos. So you heard now a lot of information and I want to summarize it for you that you can better remember it, and I really like this statement and it's super relevant and important for security at scale. Jeff Bezos said once got good attention don't work mechanisms do. Think about how many hundreds or thousands of builders or people you have in your organization touching your AWS environments. And we are all humans. We all make mistakes, right, even with the best intent, right? No one of your development team wants to create or publish a new feature with a security incident, right? No one of your builders wants to use a library which is already corrupted on the internet and have a security hole, but these things happen because Humans do mistakes. So what is important for you is that you have a mechanism in place that something like this happens and automation triggers in and helps you to protect your organization as well this is very true for your security teams. You need to have a good mechanism in place to help you triage certain security findings and don't fall into alert fatigue. The key points from our presentations today. You need to have a centralized management. A team like SAP has a security team, and this team is completely empowered by your C-level organization as we have on AWS. Security is our top zero. You need to have the full support to enable a secure by default process in your organization. Secondly, I think you heard it a lot. Automation is absolutely essential when you work on scale, when you still want to be fast in the current environment. When time to market KPIs are important to you, you need to make sure that you have automation in place that supports your organization to stay secure and to be fast. And don't underestimate the human factor of it. So you need to have training and awareness for your complete builder's workforce on everyone touching AWS environments. And I really like when you said it it's more cloud native, the easier it is. We support you with service high scale services like our duty, like Security hub, which enables your security teams and your organization to stay secure and to be fast, even with massive log volumes you have and massive amounts of AWS accounts. And most important is you're not alone on this. SAP reached out to the AWS account team and asked for help to implement this kind of features. We want to sit with you in the boat, ask your AWS account team, go on the reinforced session, talk to the security experts. We want to sit with you. We want to win the race with you on security against the bad actors out there. And we shared a lot of information with you. Amos and I have written multiple blog posts. This is the last one we published on AWS, so you can scan the QR code. You can digest what you hear now and read it again and share it with colleagues. But before I end, I want to have some questions addressed to you, Amos. Which I maybe here from the audience. So the first question would be what are the default guard rates you use when you at AAP create an account. Yeah, thank you. So as I was stating, it's very important to have, for example, like all that logging directly enabled via the account creation. So when the account gets created, we always have like for example. directly enabled with it so it cannot be tampered with or manipulated by anyone, not even the user itself. The same also counts for guard duty. So for example, if the account gets created, you have the base protection and several other protection plans directly enabled with your account so that you and your users can feel secure. Second question, and we want to talk a bit about the human factor right with over almost 9000 accounts, you have a lot of builders out there in your organization. What was the biggest challenge to share security knowledge within your organization and how you overcome it? Yeah, so it's always important that we listen to users. So that's how we do it is like we host these weekly security office hours. We have like different things like AWS game days, special topics in the security office hours so that everyone is being heard and we also get the feedback directly from our users and colleagues. OK, a more direct technical question. Do you still have enabled network flow logs for all your 9000 AWS accounts? That's a very good one. I get asked that a lot, so a lot of people are looking at the network or VPClogs even. We thought about that, but in such a massive organization of nearly 9000 accounts, it would be a lot of which will be flowing around in that organization. So that's why we have not enabled by default for all of the accounts, only for specific accounts if we have specific needs, but guard duty helps us because it's more or less capturing in the background the network floor logs so that we don't need to do this on our side and we don't need to search through that massive lock volume. Thank you for this. Last question you said about Care duty. How Gore duty helps you to keep the pace on the latest cloud threats. Yeah, so we've got duty like we always get like the latest finding types and the latest like technologies types of like findings and can make sure that we not miss out on any like potential threat, any potential like attacker we're just trying to gain access to the accounts or even manipulate any kind of like, for example, user roles, tries to like get into like admin roles or something like that. So that's why we have got duty as our main component in our secure by default model. Thank you for this, Amos, and this is the end of our session. I hope we could share a bit how SAP has established a secure by default blueprint to make their organization secure and the same you can do for your organization. Thank you so much.
