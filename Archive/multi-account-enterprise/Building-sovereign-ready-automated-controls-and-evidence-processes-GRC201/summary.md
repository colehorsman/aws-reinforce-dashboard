## Full Transcript

Hi, you're here because you're addressing some aspect of digital sovereignty. Today we're gonna share with you what we've heard from our customers around the world and in different industries that has really informed how we innovate to support our customers and their sovereignty needs. We start by working backwards from our customer needs and requirements and with digital sovereignty it's really no different. We've heard from our customers that customers and our organizations around the world are experiencing changing dynamics and complexity as global digital sovereignty requirements are rapidly evolving. Our customers have shared that they need assured proof that their data is protected, privacy is respected, and access to their data is only with those that have the authority. Our customers also share that they wanna have the knowledge and skills at an affordable cost and to be able to simplify their ability to meet the sovereignty requirements and then of course they wanna have confidence that they can meet the requirements of today as well as those requirements that will evolve in the future. I'm Samara Moore, a senior principal at AWS, and I've been here just over 6 years, and I'm sharing with you today along with Rodolfo Brenez, a principal solution architect who's been here 5 years, and in this session we'll share a bit with you about the AWS customer focused approach to digital sovereignty. I'll share a bit about our digital sovereignty pledge. And then we'll go into some of the inherent capabilities and services that enable our customers to meet their sovereignty requirements and so you'll walk away with a deeper understanding of how sovereignty is is addressed with AWS along with some resources that you can dig deeper later. So if I were to ask each of you how you define digital sovereignty I likely would get several different definitions and that's because our customers have different definitions depending on the requirements that they face locally so it's true that there is no globally accepted definition of digital sovereignty, however. And talking to our customers, our partners, and in regulators, we've identified several key outcomes. Our customers, you want to know where all your data is and control where it's stored and transferred at all times. You want to be sure that neither AWS or foreign government can access your data. You want to be sure that you can sustain operations despite a technical failure, global instability, or a natural disaster. And you want assurance that you can meet your operational and compliance requirements both today and into the future for your business needs, your regulatory requirements whether it's for your industry or local regulatory requirements. And so today we're gonna talk about and you're here about different capabilities and some services that help enable you to do that. We know there is no sovereignty without foundational security. And our cloud infrastructure is secure by design, and we've been focused on security since the very beginning. Because security is our top priority, we provide assurance to 143 security certifications and standards. Again, foundational security is critical for sovereignty and so we're engaging with regulators and national authorities around the world so that we can align our offerings with national priorities and that we can support. Solutions with innovation that drive innovation as well as control and this is important so that our customers can meet their needs to be compliant as well as their need to innovate. So I'm excited next to go a little bit more into a little bit more detail about our AWS digital sovereignty pledge, and this is our commitment to providing the most advanced sovereignty features and controls available in the cloud. And we've heard from our customers a concern that they may have to choose between a full AWS cloud and a feature limited sovereign solution. And we believe that customers shouldn't have to make this choice, so we're committing to delivering even more services and features to protect your data and help you leverage the full capability of the cloud while also delivering and demonstrating compliance. So with this we're expanding on additional capabilities to provide even more fine grain data residency controls and transparency, building in additional access restrictions that limit all access to customer workloads or customer data to providing additional encryption features so that you can encrypt everything everywhere. And providing additional options so you can meet your resilience requirements and be able to survive any type of disruption. So here's just a snapshot from the last 4 to 5 years of continued innovation that helps our customers to meet their sovereignty requirements, and we're continuing to expand our capabilities to give more options for data residency, granular access restriction, encryption, resilience, and survivability. So next we're gonna go deeper into how by design we provide capabilities to help you meet your sovereignty requirements. This allows you again to address digital sovereignty while leveraging the full power of the cloud without compromising your ability to innovate. I'll share a bit about our global infrastructure and regional design ways we protect customer data and highlight services that help to simplify your efforts to manage security and compliance. So you don't have to compromise on resiliency and survivability. AWS currently has 36 global regions that are made up of clusters of data centers with 114 availability zones that are fully isolated to provide exceptionally high redundancy and availability. Each AWS region is made up of multiple availability zones, and these are fully isolated partitions that are designed to operate independently, and each availability zone is made up of one or more data centers, each with redundant network and power. Over 180 of our services are fully regionalized, and that means there's no cross-regional dependency, and they're designed to continue to operate without disruption. Also, we make sure that you are able to meet your resilience requirements and leverage the same AWS services across multiple different AWS infrastructures like a regional design. Or edge like outposts or dedicated local zones or an independent sovereign region like the European sovereign cloud. So I'll take just a minute to talk a little bit more about the European sovereign cloud because it really is a good example of us listening to customer requirements and needs and adjusting to align to national priorities. We've heard from our customers that they want to be able to leverage the cloud for their sensitive data and critical workloads, but they also need to be able to demonstrate compliance. And so we've engaged with our customers and listened to our customers, our partners, and to regulators to more deeply really understand those requirements, and we're excited that the European sovereign cloud will be available this year in 2025, and this is to give customers additional choice in how they meet their sovereignty requirements. You don't have to compromise on how you protect your data. Our AWS regions are powered by the AWS Nitro system, and this is a first of its kind innovation and the security backbone of AWS. So no one, not even the most privileged AWS admin can access customer data or customer workloads. That are running on Amazon's EC2 instances and again to provide assurance of these controls there we provide an independent report from NCC Group on the security design claims of the Nitro system. I encourage you to check out the QR code here to learn more about the many ways that we provide operator access restrictions and controls. Another key capability for data protection is the ability to encrypt everything everywhere and so that's why we recommend that you encrypt your data at rest and in transit encrypted content. Is rendered useless without the keys, so you have your ability to encrypt content that's stored in all AWS services with many services allowing customer or supporting customer managed keys. Also again for assurance, both the hardware and AWS key Management Service and the firmware and AWS cloud hardware security module are continuously being certified under Nist Phipps 140 certification Level 3 validation. We are also making sure that customers are able to automate and monitor their sovereignty requirements. So up next, Rodolfo is gonna share a bit more about some specific services that you can use to manage your requirements for controls like data residency and resilience. Thank you, Somara. OK. So Hi everyone. I would like to start going back to the outcomes that we saw at the beginning, right? We talk about digital sovereignty outcomes and let's take a look at this from a fictitious organization example. We have uh a fictitious organization named any company. And this any company is actually looking forward to build on top of all those building capabilities that Samara just explained. And at a very high level we're looking at this at this digital summary and those four main ones that we saw, right? Data residency, operator access restriction, resiliency and survivability, and independence and transparency. And from those, let's get started. First we have data residency and how I would like to how I like to approach these kind of things is basically doing a mapping exercise. What are the things that I need to achieve and what might be those services that could actually help me do it now when we talk about data residency, you start talking about data classification, right? How where are you going to put that data if you actually need to store that but once you define all those things, then you need to make sure that you have the proper governance tools and visibility to actually enforce that. And how you get started with that is what we call an AWS your landing zone. This is basically where you're gonna store all your resources, where they're gonna live, how do you start deploying those? And we have a service that helps you with that. That's AWS control tower helps you to have a managed landing zone solution that deploys those accounts, make sure that any new account has a baselining in terms of uh any guard that you want to apply, any data residency controls that you need to specify, so it helps you in that matter. And of course it takes advantage of AWS organizations and within that it gives you um the capability for you to leverage organizational units. These organizational units actually allows you to deploy specific workloads based on their requirements or regulations, right? You can have a specific organizational unit for your EMEA workloads or you can have a different one for your AP APAC operations. So this is key, as it allows you to deploy based on your business and organizational objectives and then applying specific controls to those compliance requirements. And the third one is that we start talking about authorization policies within within organizations and these are your things that you're very familiar service control policies in this case you want to make sure that any activity cannot happen on one of your ungoverned regions, right? Maybe you're working only 3 regions, you don't need all the other ones so you can. Leverage these service control policies just to block any activity within those regions or actually avoid any data sharing across a specific resources and of course we recently launched resource control policies. This is a capability for you to enforce data perimeter protections within a specific resources like for example if you want to avoid any uh unwanted access from a different identity outside your to an S3 bucket, you can also do that. And finally we have management policies like declarative policies that allows you to have specific examples around specific attributes so it beyond going only on identity and resource access you can actually do configuration evaluation and enforce that centrally so it allows you to keep control very tightly in your data and how do you actually make sure that that is staying on where it's supposed to stay and then finally you can use tax policies for example to do. Uh, any kind of tagging and follow up on your uh data classification, for example, and it gives you a very nice way to have an inventory and run compliance evaluations on top of it. Next we have operated access er restriction. And here is where we start of course talking I IM and the first one is I am identity center in this particular case we can see this as a capability for you centrally manage your workforce identity access. So it is a central way for you to manage your permissions. You can actually federate access to an external, uh, identity provider so you can centrally manage the um the permission sets that every user should have access to and not that, not just that but also which accounts within which all use are actually going to work. Then we have assistant managers. We can see this as our secure gateway for operational tasks. If we have people going in specific resources for troubleshooting, assistant manager using its capability of session manager allows you to actually audit and control user access to those particular resources and make sure that you're having visibility and everything that is happening and actually may being able just to connect without actually generating an outbound connection to SSH or RDP, right? This is uh using an inbound connection, so you basically generate output connects so you, you close that open ports. And then you have things like uh access analyzer. IM Access Analyzer allows you to actually enforce these privileged control, uh, taking a look on on over permissive, uh, policies, for example, and actually unwanted external access that might be running without you actually knowing. And of course all these tied together with IM identity and access managing uh it allows you to actually have fine grain controls over user policies. Just to tie those together if you need to make sure that you have specific guards on bound and boundaries of what users can and cannot do within your environment. Third one we talk about resiliency and survivability and we and we saw how all the regions are spread across other environments. We talk about that, uh, availability zones we know about that but from a data perspective, for example, AWS backup is our central, uh, centralized capability for you to manage centrally and schedule your backup, um, tasks and make sure that you are enforcing those backups and that you have specifying a retention policy for those. Uh, it gives you an isolated form to store those backups in a specific bowls. Uh, it protects your things like ransomware, right, in case if you are affected of those, uh, those kind of events. AWS backup is a ser it's a managed service that allows you to specify those kind of things. Then we talk about resiliency hub. Resiliency hub is basically a service that allows you to. Um, identify single points of failure within your applications, keep a specific metrics related to your disaster recovery plans, and also gives you suggestions and ways for you to improve based on your RTO and RPO objectives that you define within the service. But of course you make all that planning, but you need to to test those plannings, right? And that's when things like fault injection service comes into into the picture. This service basically allows you to uh do some cos engineering in a safe way. And you can run your experiments, you can do some testing on your plans, and it will also give you recommendations on what are the things you need to improve, right? And you can keep this on an ongoing basis, not something that you do once and you forget about it. So this service actually allows you to do that. And of course we all know Amazon Cloud, this is your central, the service that will allow you to have a strategy around logging for activity, uh, it will allow you to correlate metrics across different services and regions and and do that investigation you can set up alarms. And we also recently launched an integration with Q Developer that allows you to run a GAI based investigations where you can interact with the service, do some hypothesis on what is going on, and you can quickly identify a problem feeding from all that data they have and that the service actually already have. And then of course we have independence and transparency. All those things is great you're applying those, but you need to make sure that there's a way for you to actually provide evidence that you're doing all that stuff. And the first one, of course we have uh AWS artifact, this is our compliance hub, and when you can actually self-service. Uh, on agreements, things like HIPA VAA, you can use self-service through um artifact to do that. You can generate um reports on AWS certifications and at the stations. It is a central way for you to self-service and actually. Independently revise or review all the security controls of AWS, but that's not all, of course we also need a way for you to do that on your uh your data living in the crowd, right? So that's when things like auto manager comes into place. This is a service that allows you to map your resources to a specific compliance frameworks, industry standards you can create your own evaluate that and automatically will continuously gathering all the evidence on top of it and it will give you a chance for you to aggregate that. And of course we have cloud drill. It will be measuring all your API activity. It will give you a mutable way for you to centralize your logs and see that activity and provide uh evaluations on that and assurance on all those user activities. And finally we have AWS config to complete the picture in this particular case besides the API activity of all your identities, it will give you a historical timeline of the changes on your resources, a resource inventory capabilities, and of course you can run also evaluations. On top of those resources, if something changes, if something has been moved from compliant to non-compliant, you can actually see that and take actions on it. So it completes the picture and tells of those outcomes, but Let's take a look on, besides doing the mapping, how at a very high level this is going to look and how we see customers actually addressing this. Uh, first of all, as I mentioned, when we talk about the beginning about data residency, we start talking about a proper foundation. Customers, they speed up a new account, they say, OK, I'm gonna create a new organization based on this account. Now this account is the management account. So I will start setting some recommended organizational units, right? That way we can store our workloads on a specific. Uh, regions and I can establish depending on my objectives, what are the guardrails that are going to set up those and of course we have recommended organizational units for you to deploy for the ones that are familiar with those, we have, we always recommend for you to have a security organizational unit when you are deploying your security services, your infrastructure. unit for your shared services and you have like independent workloads that you may deploy right you can have one organizational unit for your workloads as I mentioned in a specific region and you can deploy as needed and also you can nest it and take advantage of the hierarchy structure of these organizational concepts and start building your your environment, your landing and of course one that you always recommend is a sandbox so you where your developers can actually deploy workloads and test in a safe environment. Now we mentioned that one of the things that normally we we tend to do when we talk about data residency is specifying region controls, right? And the way to do this with a native capabilities within organizations is that you can apply um region-based service control policies to do that, right? You can say, OK, any action on this particular region is totally blocked or maybe I cannot deploy specific er types of resources because it will affect or put in risk my digital sovereignty outcomes and this way it allows you to enforce your data controls uh using service control policies. And of course we're gonna look at how this evolves on data residency uh discussions. The thing is that based on those region access controls you're basically establishing a perimeter on based on your organization but what happens if somebody else is coming outside of your organization? You wanna also make sure that you can restrict them. Normally how it has been done is through resource control policies, uh, from the organization level. Before that you have to have resource policies on every single resource so that was painful to handle. So now with RCPs allows you to have a centralized way for you to do this. Uh, you can leverage that policies as I mentioned to have classification of your data and have proper tagging on just not just the data but on the resources holding that data and you can take advantage of the clarative policies that has a capability for you to centrally handle attributes on easy to let's say that you have also snapshots of your workloads. It is a snapshot, so you wanna make sure that all of those are staying private regardless of any user if they have a action on the member account it cannot go ahead and modify that because those are being established from your common controls at your organizational level. So this is very powerful and this is how you can actually block access from those uh to those resources. And of course as I mentioned, organizational unit for sandbox or um accounts you can use any center uh to establish your access controls and make sure that specific users only have access to a specific environments on a specific accounts that lives on this particular sandbox for you. Uh, that is isolated probably from your production workloads and this is where you actually start looking into this and how you can define specific, let's say access to only specific workloads and this works for every single uh single scenario. Of course there might be resources that you need to share and we recommend to use resource access manager uh to share those uh resources across your all use or your accounts. And as I mentioned, this supports um outcomes that we're already seeing, um er um restriction of your operation access and also how you actually provide resiliency and survivability capabilities by isolating these kind of workloads. You wanna make sure that everything is being locked on audit and there is a capability within cloudtrail that allows you to have an organization on cloudTrill you can where you can searchable, you can create a searchable, um, lock for all your API calls. You can create those centrally. You can establish an S3 bucket where you're gonna put all those and you wanna make. Sure that you also have inventory tracking for your resources with AWS confit that way you can track compliance and track changes within those resources and of course you wanna set SEPs to protect those environments right that way nobody can tamper those and you are not gonna lose proper visibility on those kind of changes. Supporting, as I mentioned, transparency and independence and also er survivability and and resiliency. Now of course if you're storing customer data you wanna make sure that you are protecting those only uh storing those when it's needed, making sure that there is a limited access to those uh those data storage and you can use things like SEPs to do that to prevent any changes on the bucket visibility as well and then you can use AWS backup as we saw to establish your activities of backup to establish your life cycles and making sure that those are protected. And of course you can also leverage IM access analyzer to review any data er that has an unwanted external access. You can have actually some visibility and monitoring as that happens so you can leverage that as well. Supporting every every outcome that we see here. Finally, you wanna make sure that you have observability and monitoring. Accordingly, if you use something like Amazon Cloud which it will give you that capabilities as I mentioned, it also supports investigations in real time, uh, with certain capabilities for you to troubleshoot as something happens, uh, you can deploy it with system manager that is basically, as I mentioned, our operations hub, the capability for you to log in into your AC2 instance without having any open ports. And take advantage of native AWS organization capabilities like delegated administrator, right? This is something that for example if you have a service, uh, let's say AWS conflict, only your security team should be able to see those compliance status and those uh reports so you want to delegate the administration of that service to that security team to that security account that way they don't have to be logging in into the management account. So you also prevent from those and the patterns from happening, supporting all the outcomes. Now, how can you make digital learning much easier? How you can do this in an easier way. Uh, because we just saw all these capabilities and of course those are fine, but how you can actually improve this? So we have it managed service that is your solution for your foundation to establish that foundation, and that is a WS control tower as we talk at the beginning, we talk about the landings on how a customer could start with this, how they can start deploying all the different OUs. So the control tower. Uh, service will help you with that. It will centralize that identity. It integrates with identity center or other external identities that you can integrate with the service, giving you that single sign on capabilities and manage your permission centrally. And on top of that allows you to have centralized logging of cloud thrill and AWS config as well. And protecting those resources in a managed way, it automates compliant account provisioning, meaning that you can spin up new accounts from this service, making sure there is a baseline, and if that account goes out of the baseline, it will let you know that that the specific resources might be noncompliant and you can take actions on those. And besides all those mandatory and best practices that the service already has built in, you can establish new controls from a controls catalog that I'm gonna cover in a few minutes. You continuously evolve in this landing zone uh by default you can take advantage of native capabilities and also you can customize the solutions based on your very specific requirements, right? We have customization solutions like customization for control tower. We have integration with solutions on terraform like a can factory for terraform, or you can even take approaches that are more customed to a specific, uh, highly regulated industries like landings on accelerators, so. I encourage you all of you to take a look on those if you have a specific cases that you may think that control tower will not cover, there's a way for you to customize on top of it as well. As we saw, we saw the initial landings on that we were trying to deploy with the scenario of any company to approach to achieve these outcomes. Control Tower gives you this set up, as you can see, it has a management account. It creates an organizational unit where you can have a security, uh, account and a login account, and it also gives you the capability to create new OUs. In this particular example, a sandbox OU. It integrates with identity center for user access and then you can achieve your, uh, digital sovereignty outcomes for identity. And then also data protection accounts. There is a new integration with AWS backup as a service so you can basically tell a consular these are gonna be my administrator accounts. This is gonna be my uh my backup account where I'm gonna store all my backups and you can actually centralize that deployment and then delegate that access to a specific team. As for today, actually we need to change this. It's not currently more 3 frameworks. We actually have 10 available frameworks within Control Tower, uh, since last Friday. We have over 6, 760 controls across 75 services and different control objectives that basically aligns to what we were talking, right? And besides that landing on, what are the things that we can make easier for for you to achieve those outcomes in terms of all the the things that we just discussed. Control tower within those capabilities it deploys three types of controls. It deploys detective controls that are basically those safeguards and I talk a lot about SCPs, RCPs, the clarity policies. Those are all preventative controls. But basically what you're doing there is you're basically establishing establishing a guard rail for things not to happen, right? But what, what is maybe you don't want to enforce that, you just wanna make sure that you're keeping a close eye on those things, but that's when you can actually take advantage of AWS confit integration with control tower to deploy those detective mechanisms and making sure that maybe there is a versioning enable on all my 3 rockets if I I can do that with that. And of course we have proactive controls you wanna achieve compliance to the left, you wanna do some evaluation before the resources actually get deployed, you can use cloud formation hooks and integration with control tower to actually deploy those policy evaluations and make sure that something is not happening even before it gets deployed. So let me move into a quick demo of Consular. Let me see. Alright so good. Yeah, so it works. Let me just do this. All right. Here, uh, we have our identity center. This is basically what Contoow will deploy for you. In this particular case I'm logging into my management account with proper permissions. This is a user that has the proper permissions for the sake of this demo. I will go into the service of Control Tower in this particular case, and where we're looking here is the main dashboard for the service. Uh, he is gonna be your managed land. Uh, for the ones that are not familiar, you will see here all the main settings, the main explication, uh, it's gonna let you know how many organizational units you have, how many accounts, how many controls if you have any noncompliant resources and the description of the rules associated to those, and then you have a pretty good summary of all the the accounts that are enrolled, right? If I go to the organization, you're gonna be seeing that pretty similar set up with some compliance status evaluation that to that similar to what you will see in your organization dashboard but this from a central point of view. And if you go to your landing zone settings, remember that I spoke a lot about region denied controls. In this particular case I have a landing zone that is being managed by control tower that is basically only working on a specific regions and I'm basically denying anything else that is not part of those regions. In this particular case I have 4 regions and I have not governed regions but blocked or denied regions in all the other ones. So this gives me a centralized way to do that if I go to the specific control that I deploy. It will let me know all the details of that. It's gonna let me know how is that attached. Uh, if it is aligned to any framework, and this particular setting I'm doing from the landings on settings, right? This is by default there and I'm gonna go into uh a closer look on how that will be customized for a specific organizational units in just a minute. But let's move into the controls catalog. Remember that we just saw this is the overall controls. We have 760 controls. We have multiple types we have implementation, we have behaviors, different types that we can see in this one. And if you go to the categories, you will see that we have different common controls. Let's see if we're talking about encryption or data protection. You wanna see which controls are there, how those are mapped to a specific frameworks, all that metadata is embedded in the service, so you can take a look on what those what those categories are. We have, uh, different, let's say services we have in this particular case in this region 74, uh, services covered by control tower, and you can actually start looking at the controls that could apply to those. We have in this particular case 10 frameworks, and these are from the commons that we have a CIS, Nest, and um. 800 to new ones that we just applied and we have a digital sovereignty group. In this particular case you can see all the controls that are associated to digital sovereignty controls that I might need to deploy. If I wanna take a look on maybe a specific uh common objective, uh, I would like to take a look on what I can do in terms of encryption, um, if I wanna do, uh, let's say a specific service, I wanna say, OK, what is regarding data protection on S3 buckets, and I will give you a couple of controls based on that catalog, right? And, and I can start deploying those. Uh, it doesn't mean that those are the only ones that you can do. But in this particular case it will give me all the mapping, all that metadata it's gonna ask me, uh, it's gonna show me if it is enabled on a specific OU, if it is part of any particular deployment already, and it's gonna give me a description. This one in particular actually integrates with Security Hub. If we move back to the controls, I'm gonna say, OK, show me, um, again, uh, any particular control that might be associated to this data encryption that I'm trying to handle for S3. Uh, and then, and on the detective behavior, right? These are AWS confit rules. So I can do them at the filtering, I can get into the actual type of control. And once I have that, I can centrally deploy that. And we can look at the details in this particular case I have to. If I go to the encryption address or enforce that I have a policy that requires that I can go ahead and centrally enable this. And then I can choose where I'm going to deploy that. In this particular case I'm doing it on the sandbox and the workload one of you. I'm going to select to deploy that, and it basically is gonna centrally deploy a config rule that is gonna run that evaluation on my behalf and I can centrally do that pretty easily. And then I can take a look on the recent operations. If that failed for whatever reason, it will let me know if it was successful, it will also let me know. Another one that I wanted to share with you are the region denies. Remember that I mentioned that I have a landing zone a region deny setting. In this particular case, I also wanna do that, but only for a particular you. You saw that I have 4 governed regions, but what happens if I for one more strict controls on one particular one, I need to only allow one region so I can go ahead and say, OK, let's run this control only in this particular um uh OU. I can just go ahead and say, OK, in this particular case, US is one is the only region available. Everything else besides the general setting that I have for my landing zone, this is the only one that is gonna be available. So I basically say, OK, let's do this. I'm making sure that this is what I want. I click next. This is the example of the service control policy that is gonna be managed. I can add exceptions for specific services besides the ones that are already there that are global services. Um, and they can just add that as a parameter to the exception of this SEP as an exclusion. Also I can do that same thing with principles. I can say this particular principle is not gonna be affected by this one and then I have a summary of it. I can just deploy it and in that way I can have a more strict control on a specific work uh workloads that I that I care, right? Now if we go into enable controls, this one is also something that got launched a couple of weeks back is the way for you to centrally see what types of controls I have and where are those deployed, right? Before this you needed to go to a specific uh accounts and see which controls were there. Now you can centrally have a visibility and all of that and you actually make sure that those are the ones that you that you get. In this particular case, all those those two controls that we're trying to deploy in those accounts are already, uh, deployed, and we're good to go with that part. And if we go go through the details again, it will let you know which are the mappings on that one. It's gonna let you know where are those applied. And so on. All right. Go Now, Traditional audit and evidence collection challenges we saw how this gives you the capability for you to centrally deploy controls, right? How do you can establish your landings on taking advantage of these things, but the last part is how do you independently provide transparency on all those processes, right? And how do you actually run audits on it and problems or challenges that we see customers face is basically. Right now auditing efforts take a lot of time so it is basically you do a a specific in time evaluation. You take a snapshot of how your environment looks like you gather all that evidence you do screenshots, you put all that together. And you rely on sampling right? that's something that maybe you cannot scale it really easily sometimes when you complete a report basically time passed by already and certain things that you look are changed. There is a dynamically evaluation that you need to always be running. And when you address a risk, time passes by, so it will affect your auditing process anyway. So this is when we talk about audit manager. Audit manager is a way for you to automatically recollect and generate evidence across your AWS organization. By default, what it does is that it leverage different sources. One, are um compliance checks. This is using, uh, services like AWS confit evaluations and rules. It takes also advantage of security uh hub security frameworks evaluations as well. And then allows you to provide external evidence right could be policies, procedures, emails that may not be living on AWS so you can externally provide those into the service. You can view activity from clouddrill. It will generate some, uh, responses on that one. It will add it to a specific controls. You don't have to do that mapping. It's already being done on your behalf and you can have service to service API calls to check a specific configurations as well. And a pretty high level. This is the same environment that I that I showed you before. This is also running on control tower. In this particular example, what I'm gonna do is basically instead of logging into the management account I'm gonna log into audit account that lives under my security OU because that's the delegated admin account for my audit manager service. If you're going to audit manager. Here from the console, once you log in into the into this particular account for auditing for security, you will see that you have a menu within the dashboard you have multiple things that you can do in here and you have and in this particular case I have 3 custom frameworks running uh for for presentation only and if I want to go logo into the actual controls library, uh this is basically not controls you are enforcing any controls, but this is evaluating those recommended controls from a specific framework. I can take a look at the as you saw in common controls on control tower this is a similar experience you can see, OK, I was focusing on data encryption. I can take a look on which controls I have in here available. I can see what are those controls, how those are mapped, and how are those being fed into the service, right? What are, what is the service that is actually ingesting those data within the service? In this particular example, if I I'm doing asset tracking, which are the controls that are related to asset tracking and where are those maps in this particular case is our map to SecurityH RDS related best practices. If I go ahead into the library, you will see that we have a standard controls as I mentioned, and then we have also custom frameworks. Uh, this is a custom control, I'm sorry that I created for the sake of this presentation that is basically just looking into encryption. on certain services, Dynamo, S3. EDS and what it what it what it's actually leveraging is basically a configure that like the one that we saw being deployed in Control Tower. So this one I, I take those, I go into the assessments, I go into the sample library we have 32 uh libraries right now. We have a recommended uh set of best practices and frameworks that are known into the industry. For this one in particular, I'm taking the Australian cybersecurity um assessment. If I go ahead and take a look at those, you're gonna see that there are multiple guidelines, right? If this is something you're following, well, they have several guidelines for different things that they you don't need to run all of those, or maybe you need more, right? It depends. In this particular case I'm looking at monitoring, just uh guidelines for or recommended guidelines for monitoring, and I can say, OK, I have all these controls, but I need to customize this. I can make a copy of this and I can make changes based on that. And then I can create and it's basically gonna look like this. This is gonna be a custom framework that I created. Once you're in there, basically you can take a look how many controls are there and I can run an assessment based on that and you can see it has two control sets, the one that you just saw that I created and then we have a reduced version of all the guidelines for monitoring, the ones that I that I care for this environment. I can customize that and I can basically run an assessment on it. In this particular case I have 3 assignments already running. Uh, I can create new ones based on those sample frameworks or any custom that I have, and this one I'm logging into the custom framework that I just had. I have those controls. I can see the evidence that is being gathered. I can see if those are under review or not, and once I have that I can take a look on actually making the selection of what I need, right? By default we will start guiding a lot of things on your behalf, and this particular case is looking at the logging policy, right? If I those I need to provide. Uh this is basically a sample uh I just say here this is my login policy. I'm going to upload it into the system. I'm going to attach it. To the assessment and then to the final report because I want this to appear in the final report so I just select it and I say OK, add this to the final report I confirm and I was gonna get added to the to the evaluation. Once that happens I can just go ahead and do that. Now if I go back in this particular case I can see all the controls I have the summary. I can mark those as review and once I know that everything is reviewed and how I need it, you can delegate those reviews as well. You can make sure that you add those into the actual reports and now one way to do that is on how I show you, but you can also run. Um, leverage evidence finder. Evidence Finder is basically a service that powers by cloud trail lake technology. So a Gaus in this particular case I'm taking an assessment and doing a sample, uh, of all the compliant resources and I'm grouping those based on the control. So show me all the controls, um, basically doing an analysis and gathering all that evidence, uh, taking advantage of this service, and in this particular case I just wanna take a look on the evidence of the control that I just created. And I want to add that to the particular let's say report so I can say this is compliant based on the rule that I just have in here it's gonna tell me how I'm getting that one. I can see the details of that rule, what it's doing and actually is if I go deep into the actual piece of evidence you're gonna see that it has besides that is gonna give me the RNs of the resources that are running is gonna explain me that is basically taking advantage of an estuary. Uh evaluation rule within conflict and it's gonna tell me that it's complying based on that conflict evaluation and I can just go ahead and add this evidence to the final report. Once I have that report. I can just go ahead and generate uh when I have that assessment with all the evidence I can generate a report and basically when you see the evidence selection, these are basically explaining what I just showed you and from here I can just decide and say, OK, once I, I'm sure that everything was how it's supposed to be done I can generate a new report. And once I regenerate the new report, I basically name that, and that report is gonna live on an estuary bucket. I can generate every single time I need a new report based on that continuous evaluation and that continuous compliance, uh, feature of the service. I can keep continuing. If I get an audit like next month, two months from now, next year, I can continuously be running and just generate a new report based on that. Once I generate that report, you have this history called changes of each one of those. You can select those. You can download those. And it's gonna give you a folder of that report and you can actually run integrity checks just to make sure that the evidence was not tampered, right? And you can do that through an API, uh, call. When you go in here this is the folder structure you're gonna see in here that you have all the you have a summary of the report. You have your folders for the evidence that I just added into the report. It's gonna give me a read me file that actually explains how this is how you can run integrity checks as well. And you can also, you have a digest that is how you do it in this particular case I just take a look at the PDF that it was generated. This is a summary of course, of the final review. It's gonna explain me the accounts that were uh under the scope of the analysis is gonna show me the controls that I'm running, the owners of that is gonna have a table of contents of what I added in this particular case. I just added a couple and then it's going to explain to me how I'm gathering those. If you wanna take a closer look, you can actually. And move from here into the actual evidence. And this is just, as I mentioned, the summary. If you wanna look at the evidence, you can do that from the PDF or you can just go into the folder and expand that. As you can see, you can see, I, this is the evidence. I uploaded a uh a doc file for my login policy. And also, uh, as I, as you saw, also added the evidence for the estuary rule that he was running for for for me to check the encryption, right? So I can also go ahead open that one, it will give you the summary of that evaluation when that happened, all the evidence that I need to pro to provide that to the to any to any other could be internal teams could be external ones, and you can customize that as needed. Hopefully it will useful for you, give you a sense on what are the things that you need to do from the start, how you establish your foundation, and how do you move and keep evolving down until you can actually provide assurance on everything that you're building. Now let me just transition back to Samara that she will guide you through a real customer example real quick and wrap this up. Thanks. Thank you. All right, so I'm excited to share with you about a customer example with Vev. uh Vev, who's one of Denmark's largest pension companies, had to migrate all of its existing IT for data protection and compliance requirements. They completed their migration in only a year and that helped them support their regulated operations and get the data localization, transparency and compliance certifications that they needed. We heard about several services just now from Rodolfo, and they leveraged several of those services to accomplish this like AWS organizations and control tower and they leveraged AWS config rules along with security hub for detective controls and this was key for Velev to demonstrate compliance with the Danish Finance Authority's regulations around data handling. They were able to demonstrate data residency and resiliency. And they are further innovating now and driving efficiencies using the cloud. So we're excited to share a real example here, um, and now for some key takeaways. You should know that you can adopt cloud and meet your local framework requirements you can protect your data, respect your privacy, and architect for resiliency. And we're committed to continuing to innovate and provide more services and capabilities to meet your changing needs. So first, take advantage of these capabilities they're here, um, and as you are moving forward, you know, and you build leverage the best practices that are available, we'll continue to add more, we'll continue to respond to what we hear from our customers as well as take advantage of the native capabilities. And then reach out to your account manager to learn more about how you can leverage these services and capabilities for your environment. Also to learn more, here's some resources and please feel free to um leverage these QR codes to learn more about our digital sovereignty offerings and the offerings of our partners at AWS and also some of our online resources where we go deeper in some of the things we talked about here today and more and you can look at white papers and blogs and even some of our security service documentation that goes into more details. I ask that you complete your survey and provide feedback on this session please um and then for learning even more about some of the things we talked about here's just a few related sessions that you can attend either tomorrow or you can view them online. Also, please learn more by stopping by our compliance, our governance risk and compliance kiosk and talk to some of our professionals there. So again, thank you and enjoy the rest of the conference.
