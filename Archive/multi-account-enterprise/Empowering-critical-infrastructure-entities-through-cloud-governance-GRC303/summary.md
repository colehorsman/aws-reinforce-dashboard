## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session features presentations from multiple speakers, including Kevin, Malaji, and a special guest Rao from the Spanish energy provider Boebe, focusing on cloud governance for critical infrastructure entities. The session addresses how effective cloud governance can accelerate cloud migrations and help organizations meet stringent compliance requirements while protecting vital systems of national importance.

The speakers discuss the increasing challenges facing critical infrastructure entities, particularly in the energy, telecommunications, and healthcare sectors, with a focus on cybersecurity threats and evolving regulatory requirements. They present research from IDC showing that effective cloud governance can lead to 46% faster migrations and other favorable business outcomes, while addressing the growing concerns about ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure.

The session concludes with a real-world case study from Moeve, demonstrating how they implemented AWS services like Control Tower to achieve significant improvements in their cloud governance framework. Their implementation resulted in a 75% reduction in account delivery time, deployment of over 3,000 controls, and a 5% reduction in cloud consumption costs, showcasing the practical benefits of effective cloud governance.

I'm joined by my colleague Malaji who will be talking about AWS services and features to achieve favorable outcomes, and we have a special guest Rao from the Spanish energy provider Boebe who will share best practices with us as well. So thank you very much, appreciate your opportunity to talk with you this morning. As we get under way, I first wanna talk about innovation, um. We'll see momentarily. A resource there's research done by IDC and one of the outcomes that was discovered through this research was that workloads move 46% faster in migrations with effective cloud governance underpinning those migrations and just a quick show of hands who wants to see faster migrations in their environments. OK, it looks like it's a universal, universal outcome we want to see. How we've structured our discussion today is is really threefold. I'm gonna start and talk about some of the challenges we see facing critical infrastructure entities and the challenges are, are come twofold. One is that. Critical infrastructure entities need to protect vital systems that are critical for national importance and at the same time meet stringent compliance requirements. Then Ballagi will share AWS services and features that achieve the outcomes that we're discussing. He will touch upon both multi-count governance and automation to achieve compliance. And then last Reco will share how Moe achieved a number of successes with use of different AWS services and features to achieve. Not only the compliance, but favorable outcomes with effective governance. I want to first share a quote from the French energy provider NG. With effective governance, they were able to achieve a number of business outcomes both in acquisitions into new countries and divestitures from other countries. In fact, just in the first quarter of this year, NG has had successful. Acquisitions into Brazil, Belgium, and the UK and again underpinning this is our ability to move fast with a scalable cloud governance approach. Here are some of the Outcomes I mentioned earlier that the IDC research has conveyed. So for example I touched on the 46% faster migrations, uh, so a number of favorable outcomes with strong cloud governance, not just security compliance. In the context of security compliance. There are a number of bad actors out there. That's so largely a reason why we're here, uh, and bad actors do target critical infrastructure entities. Just in the last year alone we've seen 2/3 of energy companies worldwide having ransomware events. Uh, cell typhoon targeted telcos and then last we're probably all we in our, uh, local municipalities jurisdictions of health care facilities, hospitals, medical systems getting caught up in ransomware events, uh. This outline here is a summary of OECD examination of what's considered critical infrastructure around the world and by far and above energy is universally recognized as critical infrastructure. In terms of compliance, what we're seeing is. Because of the importance to society, we're seeing more and more critical infrastructure regulations, country by country. And in any given country where there is a critical infrastructure regulation we're seeing more sectors being pulled into that regulation and more um depth that regulators are going into uh I think one good example is Australia's hosting classification framework where initially it started with just one industry sector and more and more sectors and regulators going deeper and deeper. AWS, as you're aware, offers many different infrastructure approaches where we can meet customers where they are, everything from the 37 regions we deploy worldwide to Internet of things at the other end of the spectrum. And across the spectrum we see AWS being subject to critical infrastructure obligations in some jurisdictions and then additionally our customers who are critical infrastructure are also subject to these regulations so we see both direct obligations for AWS as well as indirect obligations because of our customers having to meet these requirements. Some of these requirements are things like having a effective cloud governance approach. Other obligations could be things like incident reporting or designating a security officer who would be responsible and responsive to security incidents. One approach we have found to be super helpful to. Begin to crack the problem of securing these environments is Purdue model and the Purdue model applies across different types of networking, uh, capabilities. So on one end of the spectrum stand alone systems these tend to be air gapped and there's not really much opportunity to leverage a cloud provider like AWS to help secure and maintain. Uh, controls in this environment, but as we work our way across this continuum and we start looking at like local systems, AWS is able to help support. Uh, things like business continuity, disaster recovery, and moving further along this continuum as we move into converged access, it's really where AWS shines. We're able to do that. Undifferentiated heavy lifting to achieve a number of controls, put the controls in place, monitor their effectiveness, adjust them as needed, and provide that level of assurance to customers. This maps really well to the shared responsibility model where one end of the spectrum, uh, the responsibility is a little uneven customers have a lot of responsibility and then as we move to more abstracted services, AWS is really able to deploy more of its controls, more of its, uh, common services, APIs, capabilities. On behalf of customers. And last I wanna touch on general industry challenges so we have challenges listed here from flexibility, regulatory and resource constraints. I would say the, uh, the ones around regulatory what we see is, is really threefold. One is that technology is changing very rapidly. We're seeing threat actors evolving their approaches and then the regulatory environment is changing very quickly as well. So all three come together and present a number of challenges. We notice that customers deal with the industry challenges that Kevin just talked about with full foundational capabilities. When they have a multi-count environment, they allow themselves the flexibility to meet the different operational and security needs of the applications and the business units that they support. Now while they have a multi-count environment, it is important for them to maintain visibility across all the resources in their cloud environment. Without visibility, they're not able to support operational enhancements or security controls and so resource management is the second foundational capability that we see customers use to meet the challenges that Kevin talked about. Kevin also covered a little bit about how regulations are changing and there are additions or modifications to existing regulations and that impacts behavior, right? You have to change the way in which you organize change management and how you onboard a new service or a new technology into these environments and having a central governance capability where you can turn your organizational policy into the technical controls that you need and deploy them across the environment becomes very important. And Kevin also talked a little bit about the challenges in having trained skilled staff supporting these environments and a controls management capability that through automation and is native to be able to take leverage of all the different features that are available in those cloud services becomes important and controls management was something we'll have reco also cover a little bit later. When customers go through this, and they implement these foundational capabilities, they're able to onboard new services faster. Now, why is this important? In any business environment. There is a challenge, a competition to be most. Useful to your customers to get closer to your customers and to be able to do that, the ability to leverage new technology as and when it is released becomes very important and effective cloud governance does enhance your ability to leverage these new technologies. And together with effective monitoring that is part of cloud governance, you identify opportunities, and these opportunities help you save cost and time. And together all these capabilities that you build will also make it simple for you to meet your regulatory and audit requirements. Another perspective to this is that cloud governance is not a standalone capability. It is not isolated. It is tied very closely to your cloud governance journey. Now we see customers in 3 buckets depending on where they are in their cloud adoption journey, and it aligns a little bit to the Purdue model that Kevin covered earlier. If a if as a customer, you're just getting started and you have a few pilot workloads or are focusing on a specific use case such as Gen AI. Then security is important. You want to ensure the data that you put in the cloud is secure and safe, and you want to have uh easy access to best practices so you can efficiently onboard these technologies. Now for customers who are migrating, they've decided on what cloud platform they want. They have an initial environment and are moving workloads actively. Speed is important. No one wants to have a parallel environment where they're maintaining the same workload, right? It is too much overhead in terms of operations and so speed, along with flexibility to be able to manage operational expectations between different workloads, 1 may be critical and 1 may be not as important. And monitoring to ensure the business is receiving the same level of performance and security expectations that they have. There are customers who've gone through the migration state. They have a cloud environment and they're looking to optimize it. And in this stage, visibility is very important and the reason is when you know how your resources are doing, you identify opportunities to improve on cost, to use the best possible resources that give you the most performance. And you also have the agility to enable new services and equip your application teams to build faster. Regardless of where you are in that journey. We see customers generally. Take a 3-stage approach to be able to implement effective cloud governance in stage 1. Which is a crucial part of any endeavor is to assess and plan. And understanding your environment is how you assess it, and we've provided a link to a tool which allows you to compare your environment against AWS's best practices. Now there are partners who also provide similar service of reviewing your environment against the AWS recommended best practices. This assessment gives you an initial state and in the next phase of this, you define your operating model. And in the operating model you determine what is your end state, where do you want to go to and establish the path from where you are to where you want to go. A key part of this assess and plan phase is to establish metrics to determine what is good for your business, right? Do you want to get to the end state in 1 year, in 2 years? Is it more 6 months? And then how do you, what is each step of how you get to that journey? And as you move through this, The next phase is about implementing foundations. Implementing foundations, a word that we use here is called landing zone, and this is a term that covers uh initial baseline environment that follows well architected principles and has a set of accounts that most customers find useful. It also has a set of foundational capabilities such as logging and resource management and identity. And to be able to start with this foundational environment gives you the ability to establish controls, and those controls may be proactive, preventive, or detective. We'll cover a little bit about the details of those a little bit in the presentation. And through the implement foundation phase, it becomes important to validate and test whether you're meeting your control objectives. And as you validate and meet. You'll notice that control tower is one of those services which can get you to the implement foundation stages very quickly. Moi benefited from that and so do a lot of other customers. It establishes a landing zone environment. That is foundational. And a key part of this, it provides you the ability to automate account provisioning and account provisioning is how you would deliver cloud services to your internal customers. Control tower continues to improve its catalog of controls. Right now there are 500 and more being planned, and you will see that these controls offer an easy way for you to meet expectations of any existing regulatory or standards frameworks that you may be using. Now, apart from Control Tower, we see customers also create their own baseline environment with AWS accounts and organizations using an API or a tool of their choice and can take as the resource management. Tool of choice. Now I want to draw your attention to the last icon, the AWS audit manager. Could you raise your hands if you ever had to respond to an audit request? If you have to collect evidence, it presented. I'm sure it's a lot of fun, right? So what audit manager does for customers here is automate the evidence collection and presentation part. So if you haven't looked at this tool recently, I encourage you to take a look at it. These are some of the cloud governance services. There's more to come, and I invite Rao to walk us through how my way is doing this. Hello everyone, I'm Rao Martinez, head of cloud governance at Moeve. For those who are not familiar with Moeve. Sorry. We are an international energy company visiting Spain with more than 19 years history and now we're focusing on sustainability, energy and mobility. OK, what about my team? I'm part of Club Center of Excellence and what our fundamental mission is collaborate closely to the cyber security operation and networking team to have the more compliance, security, and standard environment possible to our developer team. Our journey to the cloud began in 2015 where we start working with a few number of accounts trying the big data. Then in 2018 we create our we we created the club Center of Excellence and we deploy our first landing home that was based in the IWSS Landing home. And the end of 2022 we migrate all of our our governors and including the landing zone to to control tower. Let me stop here to share with you some of the highlight of the impact to migrate our our first two tools to to control tower and the expertise that we have in cloud governance. We reduced 75% of the time that we spend to deliver a new account for the developer team. We send more than 60,000 notifications. Then I'm going to explain you how we do that. We improve our cloud security posters. As you can see here, only with control tower, we are deploying more than 3000 contracts in our organization. We reduce a 5% of our cloud consumption cost and we reduce a 45% our staff needs. We're working with 6 different organizations. All of them are controlled by Contro Tower. Oh, we have more than 200 accounts grouped by more than 75 different accounts where we have applied more than 250 different control just with control tower. That means that we have thousands of control in control tower. Sa of account factory and our automation on boarding, we, we can deliver a new fully functioning account for our developer team in less than 2 hours. Our mindset is always go one step further. And we, we can see that with control tower we have all the world do it for that we, we deploy different security policies through security hub for us it's not the same when you are working in samples or you but when you're working with production on you for that it's not the same, the policy that we apply it. With all the new accounts have guard duty inspectors, still advance. I am actually analyzer default. And of course, we are deploying a lot of Contrast property and a detective, so cloud formation taxed. Once again, we go a little more. From from our club center of excellence we are deploying a lot of different custom service control policies, the gray policy, the self control policy. If it's a policy we love it and we apply it always. We have our custom war hooks and something that we call automation remediation that I go to explain to you later. The 3rd stage in Implementing effective cloud governance is that of expand and optimize. All of these are recommendations for you to follow, right? You may find that some of the elements that we've covered in in one stage is more important for you to start with, and I think expand and optimizes one such phase. How customers scale their cloud governance is we talked about a set of foundational capabilities that are implemented along with your landing zone. We talked about multi account management, we talked about controls, we talked about how you can have a centralized governance platform through control tower. Now, AWS organizations, the other service that I covered is the foundation of how customers manage their multi-count environment and it has over 40 integrations. And these integrations allow you to centralize governance over backups over cost management or observability and security. So what this gives you is the ability to enforce your organizational policy through a set of guard rails that allow more independence for your application teams and what that does again in in turn is. Remove that overhead of centrally managing all your controls through the cloud architect or security team and provide some ability for the application teams to manage a portion of the controls in their environment. And at this stage we also see customers focus on continuous environment improvement and how they do that is they engage in conversations with their stakeholders, with their internal and external customers, and they continue to identify opportunities for this improvement. We talk a lot about measuring and adapting your cloud governance posture, and one of the ways in which we see customers do that is to have eyes on the environment, not just in terms of what resources are being created, updated or deleted, but also about the state of configuration and whether it meets a certain compliance or security expectation. And config is one of the services which allows you to do that. If you haven't looked at it lately, think of the service as one that it ensures you have a state recording of the resources in your environment. So state and configuration recording is its primary use, and from there it allows you to detect drift against established baselines. And once you have that, you can also connect it to other AWS services, which are integrated where you can remediate these non-compliant situations. Now, with this flow, configure is very powerful for implementing any type of cloud governance controls. It's not just the controls of the services that we talked about, right? AWS has controls layered in through a lot of other services, and generally we tend to categorize them based on where they fit in in the. In the pipeline of how you deploy infrastructure as code into your environments. I'll start from the right. Proactive controls allow you to scan your resources before provisioning and thereby prevent any non-compliances in the environment. And detective controls, which config is a big part of, love you to respond to non-compliant situations in your AWS environments. Preventive controls are very powerful. What I see with customers who are in the optimized stage is that they get better and better at identifying those type of preventive controls that can ensure that they don't have the the overhead in detecting and then responding to noncompliant events. So a new set of controls that we've launched, including resource control policies and declarative policies allow customers to have greater and more granular control over the things that go on in the AWS environment. I invite Reco again to help show some practical examples of how he's doing that. Hey, it's me again. Uh, now I want to share with you a few example of how to do these things and more. Everyone here know the importance about enforce the I am permission boundary and more when we are trusting the, the ability to create and the role for our developer team. Can we get a raise of hands on who is using permission boundaries? How many people here? I am permission boundaries. No, you don't have. No, I don't know. We have a good thing to show you today, OK, in our organization, every single account has its own permission boundary. Right now we have more than 140 different permission boundaries. We don't have more because sometimes we say the same place of the policy for different accounts when you have the same project and different environment, developer production and Q&A, we share the same template. And obvious, we are enforced that all the new role of when you date an existing one, you have to attach the permission boundary. If not, you are not allowed to to create a new role. And who, who can make this possible. It's pretty easy. Here you can see we create all our new account with control tower, but this is the same. Whenever you create the the this the account, we detect the new account is created, but even re rule. This rule go to trigger a landa. This land go to create a folder in S3 bucket with the ID of the account and put inside it and play for the policy for the provision boundary. The first boundary we create for a new account is minimum permission. Then this this bracket have every notification enabled. When you create a data object, we go to trigger another land. This land has the ability to update to create a stacks that go to create a stack in the chill account, to date to create the boundary. But once again, we don't stop here. We integrate the 3 bucket with a guiha repo and we only have to push a new place to start the flow. And of course, our development team have the ability to create poor records for their custom boundary. And then our team for the craft center of excellent approve of the name. If we approve, start the flow again. Let me show you with a sample with a demo that I see that this is better. Here you can see a policy that is that with which one we are enforcers, which service control policy. The naming is platform and boundary, and you can see that only allow E2 and S3 buckets. They Now I want to show you how I create this policy with this tax. OK. Now I go to the report, to update it and add land the land the action. A relanda, I put a wire card. I know that this is not a good approach, but it's only a demo. I The file I commit and push the red. Now the flow is is starting. We have to wait a little for look how they they start start to dating. It's not magic, OK? It's it's just a land and we have to wait to start the land and then they start. Here you can see that this is that in progress. A few seconds later, go to finish the date. And then I go to show you in the policy. I refresh the page and show how now we allow lander. Yeah, we have Now I go to the policy, sorry. I And here you have. Now, this boundary allow land action. Now I want to tell you about managing security group in our organization, our cyber security team is very strictly with the security group rule. For that we have a different approach. When we are deploying infrastructure, we apply to different po two different controls from control tower, easy to peer 3 and Pier 4. But what happened when some developer guy make some change by the console? We know that it's not a good approach again. But in every organization sometimes the developer have to make change my culture. For that situation we deploy a conflict route that go to the deck when you open at least port to the to the world and go automatic remediation with a system manager document. Once again, I'm going to explain to you with a demo, but the thing it's better to understand. Here I have security group. The names are for, of course. I got to add a new rule, LDP open to the world. It's created Now I got to share with you the the conflict rule that we create. Here is the document. Here you have the, the conflict rule and the remedy tax we apply when you open this part of the world. Automatically go to execute the document. Now I want to show you how it is executed. And if I come back to the security group, the security the security group rule is out here. Once again I told you that our cyber security team are very strict with security group rules. For that we construct one goods on war hooks that don't allowed to open a port range for anywhere. You only have put one single port. Here I go to say you have I create a template, a valid template that go to pass our custom war hook because only allow one port, and then I go to change to put a range and it's blocked. Now I'm going to say you didn't play it. To show how it's only just single port for 100 open to just a single IP. Yeah, you can see the template it's for 100 alone and single IP. Now you can see how our custom hook is invoked and how pass it, and the security group is created. OK. Now I go to data template and put a porch. In this case, I go to put from 100 to 101. It's just two ports, but it's a range of ports and it's not allowed in our organization. Yeah, you can see that these arranged ports. And how it's invoked our custom hook and block the deploy and you can put a port range in your inbound security group rules. Now I want to share with you our system notification. Right now, we have, we have 100 different types of custom notification. All of them are based in the Amazon services were like at the framework, and over the last year we send more than 16,000 different notifications. How this made possible? We have two different sources. One are budget in real time events like for example, when you put a snapshot public. Another one are bus in our in other data source that is scheduled it maybe twice a day, 1 a day, one for weekly it's the best the the event that we want to catch. That data source can be our own inventory or something like through transit advisor Security hub or whatever and then the flow is the same. We detect the events we trigger a land, the land that go to the child account to take the tag for the resource that that do the events. Then we have the event, the resources and the tag, and go to the credit to our database project to know who is the owner. When we have all the needs that we. All the things that we need, the event, the source, the tag and the owner, we can construct a email and send to the owner and say, OK, you are, you are the projects that is not compliant with our rules. Now I go to use an example visiting the world the framework. Maybe it's everything in English, OK. Here you can see that it's cause stimization operation excellence, full tolerance, and performance. Once again, our, our notifications don't come along. In some cases, we have enabled automated remediation. Uh, it's, uh, we have automated remediation in the two pillars only in in stimization and a security one. You can see that over the last year we sent more than 2000 different notifications about cost and 4.4.5,000 notification of our security and how 75% of them have automatic regulation enabled and how we can make this possible. Remember we have the event, we have the resources, the tax and the owner. When the event is uh have enable enabled remediation, we have trigger a land that assume alone assume a role in the child account and change the the results on even the letting if you are doing something really really wrong. And then it's the same. We have all of them and send the email to the owner, but in this case, I put a line where where we told we change the result because you're not compliant and we delete it. I want to explain with a with an example, OK? For example, we are controlling how you create the TMS keys. You have to put rotation automatic enable always we control it in infras that go with the control from control tower KNS peer one. But what happens when you do click ups is the same situation that thought before. In this case, we have remediation. Here, I go to create a key. I put the name I do next, next, next, next. I don't want to stop in the permission here because it's a demo, but all of you know that it's important configure the correct permission for the kid. When you create a key by the console, you cannot put automated remediation enabled. Here I'm going to show you how it's disabled. Here you can see that this is disabled. Now the floor, the floor is is running. Here I have the event, the pattern to the event to detect the this and we send to the central bush where the magic is happening. Now, if I come back to the to the resources and rephrase. What? I can see that this enabled. And just a few seconds later I go to receive. In this case it's me because it's a demo and I'm the owner of that house. I go to receive. I mail while the system is talking to me that I create a key with a remediation without rotation, sorry, and they change for me. Sorry about about the mail is in Spanish. You have to trust me that it's it's talking that I say you are reading the what what I am talking, OK? Here you can see that uh the system change is the key for me. Now I want to share with you in one case we delete this the result here I created. I don't record this one because it's too too late and it's a little boring for that I only have some screenshot. Here I create open search domain public. You can see in the red box that is public and the name and the apps. Here is the heaven when it's creating the resource. And here is the mail where the system told to me that the lead because it's not allowed create public. open domain in our organization. We cannot control this this result with SCP. If not, we do it. If we cannot do with SCP, we construct the remediation. Here you can see how it's deleted. OK, that's all for my side, but before I leave, I want to share with you some of the lessons that we are learning about this year in in crowd governance. You don't have to see in every in every service like isolate one. You have to go to make all that all of them work together to construct your most compliant security environment. Always look for more, more remediation, more automation, more controls. Always look for more. Work closely with the product teams to enable new futures. With with the guys that from IWS that are closer to you for uh talk about your problem, your solution for the guys expertise in in governance like like these two guys. Automate everything. You have to automate everything. You cannot go manually to change every resource that all the developer team are deploying and continuous improvement. You have to improve, improve and again improve. When you see that you, you are all the world doing it, no you are not true you have to improve again. Continuous improvement. What a great way to bring it all back. Thank you, Reiko. And with that, we think we've come to the end of our presentation. We are going to be available near the entrance if you have questions on how Reo did most of this for Moiwe or questions about services that I or Kevin can help answer. We want to thank you for your time and, uh, to provide feedback. We would love to hear from you.
