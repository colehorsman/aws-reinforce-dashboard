Hey everyone, uh, thanks for taking the time to come by today. So I'm Brian and Flores. We both work on one password developer, and today we're going to talk about securing app development with one password and AWS Secrets manager. Um, so when preparing for this talk, I was thinking about the themes that connect AWS and one password, and one of the things that is in our history is make things simpler. Um, I recall the first time I learned about AWS and it's coming up on the 20th anniversary, I think next year, and. It was one of these things where they launched S3 and I was like, ah, that's kind of strange for Amazon to launch that. And here 20 years later, they clearly identified that making things easier for developers, even an engineer in a dorm room, to have access to the best infrastructure was going to change the game. And when we think about one password, that's the same kind of trend across our history. So we started as a 2005, a consumer password management offering. I became an early customer. I was a long time customer before I joined the company, and what's been key the whole time is make the simple thing the secure thing. Since then though, we've evolved into a massive B2B offering as well, with over 150,000 customers using our products and services. And so last year we announced our extended. That access management offering and that includes device health and really it's about securing every login to every application from every device, no matter where your employees are. And so today we're going to talk about our new integration. So yesterday we announced a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS and we also announced AWS Secrets Manager sinking, and we're really excited that this is built on top of confidential computing platform and AWS nitro enclaves, and Flores is going to walk us through some of that a little later. So one password extended access management really about securing every single sign in to every application from any device, and this allows you as IT and security professionals to feel more confident saying yes to your employees when they're starting to use new types of applications because one password gives you that safety net to ensure the security policies you need are enforced and available. So when we think about. The problem this is a durable problem. So getting back to today's talk and our integration with AWS Secrets Manager, one of the most durable problems that's happening right now is secret sprawl. It won't go away. And here's some stats on like what's happening right now. And so really we believe that we can make the simple thing, the secure thing when it comes to secrets management. And what does that mean? Developers need simple secrets management. They have enough on their plate. They don't need more complex workflows to manage their secrets. And what we're doing is bringing simplicity to Ses management by leveraging the one password, password manager, desktop client to embed that in the in the desktop client your developers are already using for their password management. So one password developer, you can think of it as sitting alongside our leading password management offering, and that's obviously where we are known from, as I mentioned in the history of the company, but we're also a leader in pass key security in coordination with the Fido Alliance and one password developer sits alongside. Passwords and pass key support and it has all the tools you need for the different types of credentials your developers are using. There's a built-in SSH agent. There's secrets management built in, so it really is this bundle of tools all in the one place and with the user experience, users love about one password. And so when we break down one password developer, what's in there, you have the tools bucket which, as it mentions the SSH agent, and Florist is going to demo that as well. We also give you the integrations you need, including the new one we're announcing yesterday. We announced yesterday. So but you also get the building blocks you need. You have the CLI, you have SDKs, and you also have built in CICD integrations if you need them. And then this week we're announcing environments feature within our desktop client uh password manager and also our secure syncing to Secrets manager. And with that, I'm gonna hand it over the floors to walk us through. Yeah, thank you, Brian. So I'll show you how one password can make your life easier throughout the entire uh stages of of the software development life cycle. And to do that, I have a a little demo application here. It's my first time in Philly and I've been told it's always sunny here in Philadelphia. So Brian and I made a little application that lets you ask questions about the weather to see if that's actually the case, and then give recommendations on places to go based on the actual weather forecast. So. For a project like this, the first thing I wanna do is is set up Git and SSH, uh, and I'll probably have to Google the exact SSH key gen commands that I have to run in my terminal, come up with a random but memorable pass phrase, copy the public key from the doub file on disk, go to the getup settings, paste it in, go back to my terminal, even all the SSH agent command. And Run SSH ad to decrypt and add the key. A lot of work, really a lot of work. So with One Password's SSH integration, this is now all natively built into the One Password desktop app and into the browser extension. So I can generate a key right from the GitW UI and automatically fill in the public key, and then I can use the SSH agent that that's built into the desktop app to authenticate all my Git commands from my terminal or from my IDE or Git client. Um, so yeah, you may recognize the, the GitWI here, uh, but now I can generate a key right from the, the UI without leaving the browser. So I'll, uh, click create and fill, um, and if I now run a, um, a git command in my terminal, um. The SH agent will ask for biometric approval, um, so I'll prove that one password unlocks and my get get command will, uh, succeed, um, and what's nice is that this also works for Git commit signing so you can pull, push and sign commits without the private key ever leaving the one password application process, um, and setting it up only took a few clicks in the UI instead of all these commands, um. But yeah, as you know, SSH keys are not the only credentials needed in the development process. So this application will need a weather API key to fetch the weather data, and it'll need a Google Places API key to come up with these recommendations. Also, I want to use different credentials for our dev environment and for our product environment. Um, so as Brian said, we just launched some brand new functionality that allows you to define secrets and other environment variables right from within one password. Um, so in the desktop app, I'll go to the developer tab. I'll go to the uh environments card, and I'll create a new environment to use for my local development set up. I'll give you the name And then I'll uh click new new variable and I'll add the the weather API key. And I'll add the Google Places API key. And I'll save that And it was also good to know if you already have a dot in file on disk you can easily batch import all the environment variables into one password, um. So with the secrets now saved in one password, I can invite my team and and have them collaborate on this environment and give them the permissions that they need to do their work without depending on me to be some kind of middleman that I really don't want to be, um, so the team can make edits as they need right from the one password desktop app once I invite them, um. So yeah I have the secrets now stored in one password that's cool, but how do I load them and use them in my application and this is where the new destination step comes in um. So here you can you can configure where you want the secrets to actually end up um and for the secrets in my dev environment I wanna be able to use them in my locally running application um. And to do that I can have one password mount an in-memory.n file that my app can access as if it were a regular.n file. So that means I don't have to change my application code. And similar to SSH, this will trigger an unlock prompt. Um, and upon approval, one password will populate the file with the environment secrets that are defined here. So Um, if I click on destinations, I have a local end file destination configured here at configured at this path. Um, and if I, if I then go to the terminal and I try to read the file. I will get prompted to populate the file, and I'll approve that again with biometrics which will unlock the file and unlock one password to uh provide the secrets to my application, um, so the secrets are not loaded on demand from one password. With a little comment that this is uh is generated by one password so it's it's it's one way. Um, yeah, so now in my production environment, um, that's a little bit different, right? So my application will run on AWS like pretty much everyone else here in this venue, um, and my application has permissions to access ADS Secrets Manager, but how do I now get these secrets into ADBS Secrets Manager and you guessed it, that's another destination. So with the brand new, um, ADBS Secrets Manager integration. You can configure secrets to be automatically synced to AWS so that any edits that your team makes in the one password app, they will become instantly available to AWS Secrets Manager. Um, and yeah, here's how that looks. So I'll go again to the destinations tab, but in this case it's not a local file, but it's AWS Secrets manager, um, and if I then enable that, um, go to the AWS console, I'll see the secret sin here with a banner that says that the data is actually managed by one password. And so the secrets are here now even though they were defined in one password um and if I'll go back to one password and, and if I make a change. Say I want to override the log level that's been configured in my application. I'll set it to debug because I need to fix an issue, uh, and I, because it's not really a confidential value, I can also unmask it because the, yeah, it's not really, um, it makes it a bit easier to read, um, and then I'll go back to the AWS console. Here it says that it's in sync in in sync. And now if I refresh the AWS console, um, I'm gonna see the updated environment here with the new value that I just added, so it's instantly available in AWS Secrets Manager. And then my application can use one of the many AWS platform integrations natively provided by AWS to load the secrets into the app from AWS Secrets Manager. So yeah, you may be wondering how does this all work, what happens under the hood if uh someone changes an environment variable in one password, uh, and what what what happens here is that an AWS nitro enclave within the one password within one password's confidential computing system will get invoked to, uh, perform the actual sync to AWS, um. And yeah, by delegating the sink process to a nitro enclave, as opposed to executing the sink locally, we can offer, offer a much more reliable sink, uh, and an instant and always on sync. And what's also nice is that one person on the team can set up the integration once for an environment and then other team members can be invited to edit the environment in one password without requiring each team member to have an AWS credential available to locally perform the sync to AWS, so. Really enclaves have been a big enabler here and and it's really what powers this and what allows us to do this in a way that fits within the one password security model that one password is known for, where one password is unable to access the secrets or even trick the enclave into syncing data that's been tampered with. So to summarize, I've covered how you can use one password for Git and for SSH and how you can populate.N files for local development and how you can unify and simplify sence management within your team by using the built in AWS Secrets Manager sync integration and I'll pass it back to Brian to to wrap it up. Thanks. Thanks for incredibly excited by the confidential computing platform and the nitro enclaves and like the use cases they're allowing us to unlock like very excited. And I think the theme that we talked about here was like lowering complexity and by doing that we can just improve the security posture of the team and and also increase their productivity because it's just easier to use on the desktop clients they use every day. And so also 2025 focus areas, that's just one glimpse of what we're working on. But with our extended access management opportunity we're focused on more security features around device application governance and also just enterprise acceleration again, like increasing productivity by giving. Employees, the tools they need to just make the simple thing the secure thing, and then agentic AI Security, obviously we're in the nascent stage here, there's a lot of exciting things gonna happen in that area, and one password is hard at work at that as well, so you'll see more on that from us in the coming months and. And then thank you, that's it. Um, I think actually some of the PMs from the AWS Seekers manager team is here as well, so we'll step aside. Happy to answer any questions and if not, there's a one password booth just over there. Cool, yeah, please, yeah, we can step aside here, yeah, OK. Cool, thanks everyone.
