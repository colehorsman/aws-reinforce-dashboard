## Summary
This session showcased how IAM Access Analyzer empowers developers to implement least-privilege permissions through a comprehensive approach spanning the set, verify, and refine phases of the permission lifecycle. GoTo Technologies and Walters Kluwer shared their real-world experiences transitioning from decentralized IAM management to centralized governance models, demonstrating how Access Analyzer's capabilities including policy generation, validation, and the new internal access analysis help organizations scale secure IAM practices while reducing bottlenecks.

## Key Points
- **Three-Phase Permission Lifecycle**: Set (policy generation, validation), Verify (unused/external access analysis), Refine (scope down permissions)
- **New Internal Access Analysis**: Launched at re:Inforce 2025, provides comprehensive inventory of who has access to critical resources
- **Automated Reasoning**: Uses mathematical proof to determine security properties, analyzing complex policy combinations
- **GoTo's Centralized Model**: Moved from 100+ decentralized accounts to infrastructure-as-code with automated policy validation
- **Walters Kluwer's Journey**: Cleaned up 100,000+ IAM roles from 15+ years of unmanaged growth across 1,000+ accounts
- **Policy Validation Integration**: Access Analyzer integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated compliance checking
- **Unused Access Analysis**: Identifies unused access keys, passwords, roles, and granular permissions with configurable time periods
- **External Access Detection**: Discovers public access and cross-account permissions outside defined trust boundaries

## Technical Details
- **Access Analyzer Features**: Policy generation from CloudTrail logs, static validation APIs, custom policy checks
- **Automated Reasoning Engine**: Evaluates identity policies, resource policies, SCPs, RCPs, and permission boundaries comprehensively
- **Security Hub Integration**: Findings published to Security Hub with EventBridge automation for remediation workflows
- **GoTo Implementation**: Single IAM repository with pull request automation, Access Analyzer feedback in CI/CD pipeline
- **Walters Kluwer Solutions**: IAM Identity Center federation, MFA enforcement via SCPs, zero root users policy
- **Control Policy Patterns**: Reference policies with explicit deny rules to prevent specific actions on sensitive resources
- **Remediation Automation**: Lambda and EventBridge integration for automated policy cleanup and access revocation
- **Session Management**: Federation token tracking and inline policy controls for temporary access containment

## Full Transcript

So, my name is Jeremiah Dunham. I'm a senior software development manager at AWS, uh, and I lead the IM Access Analyzer team, and I am joined by Andre Human from GoTo Technologies and Jaa Haagi from Walters Kluer. Uh, we're gonna talk to you about IM Access Analyzer and how you can use it to empower developers to implement least privileged IM permissions. So here is what is gonna happen. I'm gonna start off by giving you an overview of IM Access Analyzer, then I'm gonna hand it over to Andre from GoTo who's gonna talk to you about how they have helped their engineers move faster using Access Analyzer. And then finally, Jacque is gonna, uh, play us out by talking about how they moved to a central governance model using Access Analyzer as well as several other AWS services. So to get started. The whole goal of IM Access Analyzer as a service is to help you get to least privilege. Now we know that this is a journey and not just a step that you take overnight it's uh and this is for a few reasons one because the permissions that you your applications need may evolve over time. Uh, but also just because sometimes you don't know exactly what you need and you have to over provision in the beginning and eventually scope things down as you, uh, you know, as you learn more. So the way we think about this is there's 3 phases in the permission life cycle set, verify, and refine. So you start out by setting the fine grain permissions that you think your application's going to need. This is like proactive part right as you're creating permissions then afterwards you go back and verify that you have set things correctly and that the applications have just what they need and nothing more and then finally you you often find that well you have over provisioned even by a little bit and so you want to scope things down. That is the refined stage. To help you do this, IM Access Analyzer has several capabilities. Uh, in the set phase we have IM policy generation which uses uh cloud trail logs to help you generate a policy that has just the permissions that are necessary to execute the things that we're seeing in the logs. We also have policy validation and custom policy checks. These are static APIs that you can call and pass your policies in to check for things like whether or not the policy is well formed, uh, follows AWS guidelines and best practices, and also follows your organization's best practices that's in custom policy checks. So using those you can actually look for specific things and policies and ensure that the things you don't want to show up there don't. Or the things that you do do. On the verify and refine because these two steps happen, they happen sequentially, but they happen kind of together. Once you identify the permissions that are present. Generally, you want to take the next step and refine those things. To do that, we have 22 analyzers. One is unused access, uh, the other is external access, and I'm gonna actually talk about those in more detail in just a moment. So Uh Our big differentiator is something called automated reasoning. And if you don't, if you're not familiar. Uh, I'm sure you're all familiar with IM policies and I am policy syntax, and you know that the IM policy language itself is very expressive. Has conditions, has operators, you can do all kinds of things. And if you start with just say an identity policy, maybe then you add some resource based policies add some SCPs add permission boundaries, add all kinds of things. And then you go, OK, does Jaa have access to my database? I don't know because there's a lot of policies that some allows some denies conditions and it's like I, I that it can it can get pretty overwhelming. You'll know whether or not Jaa has access to my database because at some point he will be able to successfully execute a request against the database. But up to that moment, it may still be in question. So with automated reasoning, what we can do is we can actually, the idea is again, automated reasoning. We can actually we have algorithms that can think through semantically understand the policies that are at play and answer questions like does Jac have access to my database or not. The way we do this is with uh this falls under an area that we call provable security, which is basically using mathematical proof to determine that certain security properties do or do not hold. That is what we are doing in Access Analyzer, at least in parts of it. Some of the features of Access Analyzer don't use it, but if you wanna learn more, check out the link or scan the QR code. So our mental model is pretty simple and if you're familiar with IM policies, this will make sense to you. Uh, ultimately we want to, we're trying to establish who can access what. The who's our I am principles, the what's our AWS resources, and the can is policies. So we have uh analyzers on both sides. So on the who side, this is unused access analyzer and actually I'm kinda curious for the folks in the audience, is anyone using the unused access analyzer today? OK. Great. Thank you for, thank you for letting me know. Um, if you're not using it, it's super easy. You go in, you turn it on, you can turn it on for your account or your org, and it will, you also set a period 90 days, 270 days, whatever period it is that you define as unused, and it'll tell you, here's all the things that aren't used. And that's great because your remediation is super simple. You just go delete it or change the permissions to scope it down. Now the unused stuff goes away. On the wet side Uh, up until very recently. We had just the external access analyzer, so this is also something that you will want to use uh this will help you identify um. Using the resource permissions, whether or not anyone outside of your organization or account can access the resources. OK. A little bit more about unused access analysis. So as I mentioned, you set the period. And here are the things that we look for. It will look for access keys. Passwords, roles, and also within a given role, uh, any unused services or actions. So super handy, gives you a really easy way to identify uh the unused things in your environment and go Marie Kondo style, clean that stuff up because it does not bring joy. Also, these findings get published to Security Hub. So if you use that, you can consume them there. And we also have event bridge integration. So if you want to receive notification or trigger some automated cleanup workflow using lambda or something, you can do that. All right, external access analysis. So, as I mentioned here, you define the zone of trust, either account or organization. And if there is public access to your resource. You'll find out about that. You'll also find out if any accounts that are outside of that boundary so if it's an account analyzer, if any other accounts have access to the resource or if it's an organization boundary, if there's any accounts outside of the organization that have access. Some of these things are legitimate, right? Like you might have a third party tool or a partner or somebody who you do grant access and that's cool. When that happens you can basically acknowledge and archive the finding and it will not show up again unless that access changes. Um, but if, uh, but you might also find things that you didn't expect. And those probably require a little research to make sure that whoever has access, it really should. This is one of the features in fact this is this analyzer was the original access analyzer and the first feature that we launched with many years ago and this feature does use automated reasoning to do its analysis so uses the provable security, uh, you know, assurance. Similar to unused access findings, findings are aggregated and sent to security hub, and we also have event bridge, uh, integration so that you can get the findings there. OK. So In the in the refine and verify stages as we discussed, we have these two analyzers and we've had these now first one for several years or the external access for several years, unused access for about a year and a half. And just this morning. If you watch the keynote, the first new feature announcement, new product announcement was internal access analysis. This is the accumulation of several years of research and work, and we're very, very excited to make this available to you all today. With internal access analysis, it really rounds out the picture. So the idea behind internal access analysis is that you would turn it on for your most critical resources so you can think of your S3 buckets, Dynamo DB tables, RDS snapshots, things like this that would contain sensitive customer data, financial data, the things that you really, really, really want to protect and you really wanna lock down access to. An internal access analyzer will Pull the collection of all the policies that might apply to the principles in your org or in your account that would define who has access inside the inside the org or inside the account. It does the analysis and it says, yes, Jaa does have access to my database and here are the actions that Jaa can perform and here are the conditions under which he can perform those actions. When you get the, when you get all the findings for that particular resource, you can review in a very simple fashion and say, yep, that's legit, that's legit. Oh, I gotta go look a little closer at this one. The intern probably should not have access to my production financial data. For example, So as I mentioned you can fully discover who in the organization has access this also uses automated reasoning and uh when we say uh collectively evaluates multiple policy types what we mean is identity based policies, resource based policies, SCPs, RCPs, and permission boundaries, so all the policies that apply to whether or not someone has access. And we have to do that comprehensive analysis, otherwise you might get a lot of false positives. But with this, you're going to get accurate information. We do have event bridge uh integration which is really which is great because it can help reduce the amount of manual review that you need to do because after the initial run when you get all the initial findings. Those findings will be exactly the same unless some access changes and if you're integrated with event bridge, you'll get notification about that change. And finally there is a a new unified dashboard. So if you go look at the Access Analyzer console, you will see. And here's an example External access findings and internal access findings together in a resource centric view. Now I would hope that your critical resources don't have a whole bunch of external access. But that's up to you. So the key use cases that we heard from customers that that prompted us to really push for the development of this feature was that folks wanted to wanted to have comprehensive inventory of who has access to their critical resources for security and compliance requirements which could include things like generating audit reports. Uh, they also customers also wanted to make sure that there wasn't some misconfiguration or some accidental or temporary access that was left that they just that was just never cleaned up. Uh, we also heard that manual access reviews can be really painful. So we wanted to help with that problem and then this event bridge notification, uh, to make sure that you're staying on top of things as new or modified access, uh, is granted to those resources, uh, you can stay on top of it. Before I turn it over to Andre, which I'm gonna do in just a moment. Again, I want to thank you so much for attending the session. Uh, also I want to give a tiny plug. If you're interested in learning more about internal access findings. Which includes a handful of like real world use case, uh, demos that we're gonna give. I'm gonna also talk more about the math behind this and why it's kind of crazy how this works. Um, that's gonna be tomorrow. I am 307, which is at 2:30. So if you have time and interest, I would love to see you there. And with that, I'm gonna hand it over to Andre from GoTo. He's gonna talk about how they help their developers move faster using IM access Analyzer. Thank you, Jeremiah. OK. Can everybody hear me OK? Um, Let me start with a brief introduction to go to. Um, as a leader in cloud communication and IT, GoTo addresses real world challenges with practical innovation and a customer's first mindset. With our simple to adopt, uh, sorry. Now I'm trying to speak German as well, so that's not good. Um, sorry, I am a bit nervous. This is the first time that I'm doing this. Um, with our secure, reliable, and enabled solutions, which are simply adopt for small and mid Medium sized businesses and scale to enterprises worldwide. We have about 2800 employees. Over or in multiple countries with nearly $1 billion in annual revenue, demonstrating. Go to global presence and um Continuous business growth. Some of our products Or go to connect our online phone system, which is a cloud cloud-based um telephone system with features such as voice. Video conferencing and messaging. Logmin resolve and all in one. IT management and support software for small and mid-sized businesses and managed service providers. It's part of Go's line up to try and streamline. IT support for these type of companies and then also Logmin rescue, a customizable remote support software for enterprises. It enables IT teams. And support professionals to remotely supports their customers and access devices and provide the support in a fast and secure way wherever they are in in the world. Um Through strate through strategic acquisition over the past 15 years, um, we've grown our footprint in AWS significantly with over 100 accounts, supporting our teams across the organization with 600. More than 600 IM users for programmatic access. With more than Or with thousands of accompanying roles and policies. Um To ensure the right permissions at scale. AWS was central to our um to our move from on-prem to a multi-cloud environment. And This is some of the key features that we're actually using in AWS at the moment, like EC2, S3, RDS, EBS, OpenSearch, and LB. We were also part of Zalova or early adopters of Zalova and also participated in its presentation at Reinvent in 2018. And as you can see, Zalova was the predecessor to Access Analyzer. This early engagement actually demonstrates GoTo's ongoing commitment to innovation. And best practices in Cloud security and governance. Um Starting with this, uh, with the scaling, I am actually became a complex challenge for us within the company. We had teams that were able to manage their own IM across various accounts, which was somewhat problematic. We introduced a homegrown solution with a combination of services like cloud formation, Lambda, and Sallkova, you know, largest uh shared accounts, which was actually very decentralized and Kind of made our team to become guardians for these kind of deployments, um. We also try to incorporate third party tools like cloud explaining and um Parliament to try and address, address some of these issues that we've been having with managing our IM on this type of scale, but that did not um fit our needs. That actually led us to introduce or look at Access analyzer Because we needed a more standardized and automated approach and led us to actually incorporate Access Analyzer into our workflow. Um One of the main challenges that we had was, like we mentioned before already, engineering teams were able to commit or make IM changes directly in the accounts, whether that was Programmatically or directly within the accounts. Um. Trying to mitigate one of these or actually trying to mitigate this problem led to new obstacles when we introduced Some of the requirements that our team had to manually review um these policy changes and Like I mentioned, it introduced additional problems because These requests came in as direct messages, emails, um, poor requests or tickets. And because we now have a central team that tried to to manage this, we became a bottleneck for some of the teams. And it became time time consuming and we caused significant delays and blocked engineering teams at some stages. This also slowed down the engineering teams because sometimes the governance team had to reach back out to the engineers to get clarification. Which increased obviously the overhead and the review cycle. We address these challenges with clear goals. We introduced the requirement for least privileged across all of our um resources. We needed to increase the speed and flexibility for our engineering teams to boost productivity. We need to empower our engineering teams to be able to work independently and provide something that was somewhat self-service. And we needed to automate compliance checks and best practices. And provide timely and actionable feedback to ensure These secure changes. Now how do we address these? We implemented a few key strategies. We're defining all of our all of our IM resources as infrastructure as code in a single centrally managed repository and automation pipeline where engineers can create full requests that can be tracked and reviewed. In one single place. This peer review By the engineering teams or in certain cases where escalations are needed, the governance team also helps with our SOC2 compliance. All of this was built around access, analysis, validation capabilities, and custom policy checking. This enabled us to make sure that It we reach the maximum compliance that we can within the company. Um, these automated deployments. Also gave us reliable feedback for the engineering teams to know. What they actually need to address. Now, let's quickly have a look at a high-level overview of how we've implemented this. So, as mentioned, we've got a single IM repository where we house all of our code. Engineering teams create a pull request or commit the changes and create a pull request. This actually triggers our automation pipeline. Within our automation pipeline. We've got Access Analyzer. Once this is kicked off. Access Analyzer actually takes the new policy or the updated policy and compares it against a set of control policies that we've had. It generates feedback and commits it all, yeah, put that. Feedback as a comment back onto the pull request, giving the engineering team an idea of what they need to fix to be able to move forward again. If the actual validation passes. It goes back to the engineers, where somebody from the team needs to Review it before it can actually be applied. If not, if the validation fails, it goes back to the engineer to make changes, make sure that he's compliant. And adheres to company best practices. And it will actually kick off the pipeline again. If there's an exception, say for instance, somebody needs a certain specific permission that we don't allow that is actually triggered as an exception, and the governance team needs to decide whether or not they can let us pass or not. And as you can see, it can. be applied or it gets reverted back to the engineering team. And then lastly, Any changes that is required from The engineers or from the reviewer goes back to the engineer who actually then needs to Update the the pull request with new. With new data or with, with some changes to make sure that it's compliant and follow our best practices. Now, this is an example of a failed validation and exactly how it would look in our pipeline. We've got overly permissive permissions in the policy document, which is S3 GateStar and S3utStar, and also a resource star which is not allowed within our um Within our regulations. And this is you can actually see on the output. It is clearly stated there that what needs to be changed, what needs to be updated. And why it is problematic. So this is A nice little example. To mitigate that, this is basically the same policy but just In a passing state. So what we've done here is we've updated. Um The actions. So instead of having S3 or S3 get star, we now have S3 gate object and specifically S3 put object with also a very specific resource ARN. which adheres to our um. To our policy structures, right, and The output confirms that. So from the cloud architecture team or from the governance team side, we don't need to actually do anything here because the engineering team can just approve this and it will actually be applied. And this is An example of a reference policy and an updated policy. This, um, In this case, The control, the reference policy starts with a very permissive section with allow action and Which is a star and a resource which is a star, which is very permissive. But just below that, we've got the deny rule which explicitly denies specific actions on, on a very specific resource. Now how this works is when you create a policy like you can see here where you've got a specific set of actions and a specific resource. Access Analyzer actually compares the two and see that it is compliant. If I would change the resource ARN. To match the one you see in the control reference policy. It will fail and it will not pass the validation. And that is How we actually have these set out. So this can be, these control reference policies can be quite lengthy at some point in time if you limit or if you want to limit all the actions, but we, we've decided to have just certain specific Actions that we want to limit that can be problematic if we If we allow that. Let's look at some of the Key benefits is actually gave the company, right? So It improved our turnaround times and it enabled our engineering teams to move more quickly. From creation to deployment. We also have a higher throughput. Of For the reviewing teams. Making them less dependent on us and it's also noticeable by an increase in code commit frequency or code frequency and um Commit This actually also translates into higher quality of security and apply policies. Which allows us to have more consistent checks and reduces the risk by having Permissive or misconfigured policies. Within our AWS accounts. Finally, this strengthens our communication within the organization. By automating the feedback and the validation processes. This enabled The governance team to To change roles from being guardians to be more supporters. Empowering the company to uphold security standards. Now, let's, before I hand over to Jakka, let's wrap this up with some of these lessons that we've learned. Keep your control policy short, simple, and services specific. This makes the policies easier to understand for the engineering team and also reduces the runtime of access analyzer. Not everybody is familiar. With or fully understands the policies that are that they're trying to write. Um, you need to. Provide clear guidance for the engineering teams to ensure that they can actually write proper policies. And and that we can provide better support for the teams. Access Analyzer is a valuable tool. But unfortunately it does have some limitations. Please don't tell Jeremiah. Um For example, there is It doesn't always evaluate a policy as a whole. Um, especially when you define conditions and specific resources. This allows the engineering teams to craft policies or conditional policies. That we can try and bypass some of our Um, set out guard rails that we have. Um, Access Analyzer also does not evaluate all of the resources. And some of the actions actually require resource star, and that is something that is not necessarily picked up. Due to this, we had to implement some of these checks programmatically. And then lastly, the Access Analyzer team. It's constantly improving the service, adding new features. And our close collaboration. With the team enabled us to provide feedback, request features. And Um, discuss future enhancements of the product. Thank you and over to Jacka from Walter Kluver. Hi everyone, can you hear me? Thank you. So I'm from Walters Kluver. I don't know how many knows this company. Let me give you what about our company. So the worldview of our company is we are a global leader in professional information and software solution. Typically we are content delivery company. We sell information. Support health tax. Legal finance, corporate compliance. Headquarters in Netherlands. Also, we have headquarters in the US. New York We operate 180 countries and 40+ offices and 20,000 employees. We are actually a product company. Enables critical decisions through domain expertise and trusted technology. And recognition responsibilities we named Forbes' most innovative company. Strong Compliance focused, ethical AI and committed diversity and inclusion. Measurable impact through sustainable and expert solutions. That's the worldview of our company. And actually um, We are, uh, once upon a time was like. We grown A lot of equation through, and we are 200 years old company. We used to publish. Through paper, the information now we move to digital. We have some flagship products up to date as a clinical condition support used by 2 million clinical. Experts Like an example, I'll tell you the doctors. If they want the evidence, they cannot go to. A lot of friends or a lot of doctors to ask more information so that's how our our company sell that information to them and they can refer that evidence and then give and come to the conclusion. Say example, your X-ray says some is talking something else for the patient. And the patient is saying something else, and you need a reference, then the up to date is the, is the solution for our doctors. CCH. The cloud-based tax accounting sued for Tom firms. Teammate is, I don't know how many people know Teammate. Teammate is a corporate compliance. All big 4 companies use for any compliance for corporate, they use teammate. On some acts, a regulatory risk platform, and a blonde. Is also sustainability and management for corporate. We are also a technology innovation company focused on cloud native platforms, AI-driven analytics and automation. Strategy investment in zero trust architecture and privacy, which is, I think everybody wants to know, I mean everybody wants to go towards zero trust. Leader in digital transformation for regulated industry. We are actually, if you're speaking, we are cut across all the industry. We are a high tech company. Who develop Most of the solution. And most of the solutions are flagship. 200 plus products we developed. And most of the products are flagship. Our journey in AWS, I think 10 years is less. I think more than 10 years AWS. Uh, we are using from past maybe 14 or 15 years back, started journey in AWS. I think we had 400 data centers. We moved 400 data center to cloud. It is we actually use not only AWS we are multi-cloud. We also use Azure and GCP. But we also have a lot of solutions on AWS. When we started AWS's journey. I think identity nobody cared about it. They thought, OK, you want access, you create identity. Everybody was administrator because we are a product company. And being in a product company. Everybody wants administrative access. If you have admin access, anybody can create identity. They thought. Cloud is safe and secure by default. They didn't, they don't want it to have any security in place or governance in place. We ended up in hundreds of thousands of privileged users and IM rolls, 100 KIM rolls we had. massive, very massive. Today also we are still Uh, after 15 years, we're still trying to mitigate and clean up. Very painful. Before analyzer was too painful. We are using a lot of automations, a lot of analytics ourselves, spending a lot of time. We'll come up, we'll see how we use the analyzer and try to mitigate those issues. Broad usage. Somebody wants to access VM they need administrative access. They won't, they don't want to compromise less least privileged. They want always wanted to have bigger access. They thought bigger access, more power. Integration with multiple products we use a lot of SAS, uh, applications and integrating them. The external access, one of the, if you see that in IM lyer external access was also we were using a lot of external access and then we've given a lot of access to external products also. Uh, like an example, right, we used to use some POV. RPOC Then bring any platform, do it, then forget it. No clean up. That access will stay away. I really don't know how many in your company. They want access. They never wanted to remove access. I have not seen a single person in my company. They raise the access, they write a ticket for removing access, not even a single person. So that's how we ended up with a lot of, lot of, it's identity is complex, we all know that identity is very complex. On top of that, the collaboration from the end user is. I, I, I feel is almost 0. Never collaborate, never, never collaborate. OK, um, Yeah Your left hand side, that's our identity was. We actually around 1000 accounts in our organization we have. Every account was decentralized. As I said. We, we actually acquired a lot of companies. And every company comes with a lot of identities, a lot of rules, a lot of permissions. Lot of peace. And if you see that our identity was decentralized. And nobody knows who created which identity. There was no tagging. Nothing, nothing, nothing related to that. To identify that identity who's using. It was like a nightmare. Really, really nightmare if you accidentally go and OK deactivate. Unfortunately I don't know how many people have seen now you can deactivate keys now before it was not there one year back, no deactivation of key. It's only delete or created. Now you can deactivate. When I used to clean up this lot of mess, delete, OK, P1 ticket. Oh, this is not working. And when I sent an email, why didn't you respond? I was not aware. Developed by somebody I don't know. They will only know when you deactivate or delete it. So now, we actually moved from decentralized to centralized. Lot of advantages, right? A lot of advantages. Now, we know. That you know the identities are coming from centralized location. By default, all the identities are MFA neighbor before nothing, no MFA, nothing. And also it is we are using. Also identity. Detection EI which actually Also identify signing logs and also. Detect itself if something is coming from other places, or it is a genuine traffic or not genuine traffic or bad IPs or no bad IPs. It can, it can detect and it can also protect. That's how mood Now we're seeing a lot of advantage. Now provisioning is now fingertips for us. Challenges I think everybody has the same problem. I'm pretty sure lack of centralized governance across the nation. Believe me, one person left our our organization. He had In all the accounts, 800 accounts that I mentioned, his identity was exist. Uh, when I was started, uh, looking into those identities, the person is not there. And he has programmatic account enabled. He has identity still exists. I was really surprised. The identity was before I move to the GIS, I was in cloud security. When I moved, I saw this person left. I was knowing because I was reporting that the person, he left, he retired, not the left, he's retired. I knew that the person left. I was surprised to see those 800 identities exist. The lack of that's a lack of visibility because it's not centralized and off boarding and onboarding was. There was no off boarding and onboarding. Multi-administration creating roles, everybody was creating roles. For what purpose they don't know. They created, oh, this is not working. OK, let's create one more. That's what the approach was from developers, you know, right? Developers, they only care about their products, nothing else. No unified strategy, identity management, leading access without accountability. No tracking, no tracking at all. You can create, you can do whatever you want with that identity. They think identity is what maybe garbage they thought about nothing else for me identity is a currency. You you don't treat your currency, somebody will steal. If you see today how much compromise happening, 99% compromises because of identity, because they know they don't treat identity well. They know bad actors know very well threat always comes from the identity because everybody knows they put passwords in Excel, they put in password in notepad. They put password anywhere. They don't care identity. If you, that's the reason the compromise always happens. If you, I don't know how many people know about Mitre framework. If you see the my framework, 90% framework talks about identity. Because they know that identity is the key for everything for compromise. Fragmented and inconsistent IM configurations for all the business unit, there was no no policies, no um uh configurations like an example we. We started using SEPs and ensure that if anybody created by default or for any purpose without knowing GAS which is Global Information Security. We wanted to ensure that everybody uses MFA. That's, but before it was not. Real use cases. Cross account usage. As I said, bring POC, create rules, create permissions, create identities, forget it. Then OK, decommission the product. Then But all footprint leave behind it unmanaged programmatic accounts. Still, still I'm battling with a programmatic accounts, still. I have seen programming accounts created from the past 8 years back. 8 years back is I really don't know. I actually enforced them to move towards. Anywhere anywhere. Nobody wants. No, it's the least privilege for them, least priority for them. They said no, if I do it, I had to record it. I asked him, please, OK, at least rotate those keys or keep it in some place very safe and use that. No, no, no. We can do it next month, maybe after that month. That month never comes. Decentralized admin control. As I said, every person in I am in AWS account admin, not less than admin. Nobody is less than administrator because we being in a product company, everybody wanted that administrator access. I said no, can we have a in policy in policy access? No. Least privileged, no. Only administrator access. You administrator access next day in that IM you find 100 accounts. Who created? I created. Why? Business. OK, they know that if I talk about business, they say, OK, nobody cares because the business requirement. What business requirement, they will not explain. Absence of. Now we started also rolling out jet, and that's on demand released accounts. No approval workflow. There was no, not at all, not at all, zero workflow based. That was the real use cases we had. We have plenty of really, I think. Sorry, I mean we didn't make it all those. Lack of MFA enforcement, static role assignments. Over privileged, no automation for remediations. No logging And a lot of share accounts. One person created a keys used in everywhere, everywhere. If I go and talk, guys, do you know where it is? No, we don't know. Go, go and read cloud trails. No support So what was the goal? The real goals visibility. The key for us was visibility was a key for us because as I said, thousands of roles, we still have plenty 20,000 unused roles still from 10,000 least privileged was another one just in time access we wanted to have ensure that. Everybody Access has to be when you are sleeping, you, you don't need to have access. Why? What you're sleeping, man. You don't need access. Zero trust architecture we wanted to use assume a bridge least privileged that's the zero trust we wanted to move forward. Federation consistency, policy and governance and control, continuous monitoring auditing. I think everybody wants this. I'm pretty sure everybody wants this if you don't bring. Monitoring audit, you will end up with a lot of issues. What was our approach, right? We use Native solutions along with the AWS partners. To ensure that, you know, we actually visualize how our environment exists. One of the solutions we started using analyzer. And then if, if you are using analyzer, you would have seen 3 buckets in unused access, right? Rolls. Credentials and the permission. 3 buckets. Last week we made 0 credential. Which has not been used from the past 365 days, we ensure that it is not zero. Now the risk reduced. Thanks to Analyzer, it was. Very informative information. We went with the data, we talked to business. You're not using for the past 364 days. We wanted to ensure that we deactivate them. They said they approved because of the data. All these days was more analytic manual method and no data. When we went with the data, they agreed. That's an advantage. We use cloud trail and Confix for automation, track permissions. We are using third party also for tracking permissions along with the IM lyzer. Consolidated IM asset inventory, we wanted to use, as I said, we moved from decentralized to a centralized and ensure that no duplicate of account if they're existing in centralized ADP that exists here, no duplicate of accounts. Animal centralized logging and reporting. We now started pushing all the logs to the centralized locations. We started enabling. And we also do reporting. We use At Athena and also we use uh other Power BI also for reporting purpose. We use uh cloud trail as centralized location, keep it for data for 2 years. And we use that more oftenly to ensure that, you know, double, that's a double verification, analyze a few information, go and check it, OK? Is that real? The cloud trail showing anything related to that identity. I think 8 minutes left. Approach. Least privileged access. We started analyzing. That person really the administrator really need A bigger access. We started reading from the past 65 days, audit logs, we did logging. We ensure that the person really, really need the bigger access or not. We started moving towards privileged access, least privileged, ensuring that He is not using the bigger access. We started using inline policies. More Jason driven policies. We also started using SCPs. I ensure that I told you, as I said, we are moving towards, even though I'm giving an admin access, he cannot create identities. We are moving towards that. We're ensuring that nobody can create a admin so identity and keys. Also, we are started recently starting RCPs, but it is no, it is though it is not um related to. Identity, but we are ensuring that you know we are pushing least privileges for that. We also uses uh Kim solution, uh, with partnering with the AWS uh partner Kim Solution. It's also helping us a lot of identifications. By showing us, you know, how works, it's also informing us our privileges. Approach for zero trust, migrate from, as I said, users to Federate identity, ensuring that single, every single identity has MFA. Every single also protection. Enforcing the policies divides our access where IM policy center identities, continuous validating access based on attributes, not just identity. Federation consistency integrating AWS identity center with Azure, which is now in ID Microsoft keep renaming them, renaming, branding them by with new new names. Sometime I forget which name, which one I'm using it. Octa also use and other identity provides Ping also we use it and that's uh the integrating with them single identity standardizing low login workflows with single sign on. Ensuring that SSO is in place and I, it's also user experience, right? When you move from A decentralized to a single sign on or centralized environment you have SSO, but SSO comes with other problems you might know about those, you know, if it's SSOs compromise is compromising multiple. Environment. So we also ensure that you know SSO is very safe, OK. Migrate IM user from static credential to federated roles. We have started migrating. No less credential, more roles. But if you see, right, even rolls comes also compromise. You, there's a big bank in the US. The bank was using role And VM was actually using the troll. And that VM was exposed and that that was compromised and Roll compromised and roll was having an access to S3 bucket and then it's become a big issue. We had to be very careful every steps we had to be careful. We also need to ensure that, you know. When we migrate uh roles to roles, also roles need to be at least privileged. Don't give access access permission to roles also. Policy and governance, as I said, we started the control tower usage of control tower. And ensuring that SEPs very organized O uses because we had a lot of business units within the organizations. Each business unit has again sub sub applications each in each business unit. We created your use, integrated with the control tower. And pushing the guard rails like SCP RCPs and uh landing zones. Also, uh, I don't know how many you started using. Root elimination, we start, we are the first to eliminate roots. 0 route. We don't have any root account in our organization. We only restore in case of in case of. Break glass Sometime, but break glass also, we are using some other techniques which we use that attempt first and if not, then we restore root. Create a reusable permissions. And ensure that you know that his job is actually, as I said, we wanted to. Give an access based on the job, not based on the designation that's how we are moving towards define a clear IM ownership models to governance and policies. Use IM access policies, identify unused identities. We, as I said, we also use IM analyzers along with the other party. I am analyzer is really, really good. You can go back for 365 days. That's the beauty of that. You then you can slowly move towards 700 days or maybe 600 days, then move towards 90 days. That's the beauty of I'm analyzer. I really like that, you know, the, the approach of 365 days. Jed, also we are using previous on demand, that's a jet, ensuring that, you know, any right access. Has workflow based and approved. And also we are trying to integrate with the service now, which is our ticketing system. If the ticketing system has a P1 ticket, you get an automatic approval. Other than P1, it will not get an automatic approval. You'll have the, you had to take an approval from the designated approvals. As I said, um, MFA is the one we are actually ensuring that we are also using MFA configs by any chance. Being an enterprise organization, any anything can happen. By any chance, somebody creates an identity. That automatically goes and disables it. If it is not MFN. One minute to go. Automated scale. We also use Lambda and Amazon eventBridge, as I said. But it's not full fledged because of management condition as of now they said let's have more. Um, Detective more rather than protect you more. So now we are in detective mode also, but we started exploring towards the sandbox environment. Automatic provisioning, deprovisioning. As I said, we moved to centralized. The auto deprovisioning and provisioning, it's automatic now. Con continuous monitoring, we use enable those, as I said, we use cloud trail at centralized location and move all the cloud trail to the centralized place. We use that and we also use guard duty and other components also. We use cloud trail injection to the our SIM also. We have a SIM solution. We inject that and ensuring that. It can detect Build dashboards. We're using dashboard, Quick site and uh also OpenSearch to build the dashboards. That's for mainly basically those are dashboard used for our CISO. As we moved, we moved from decentralized to centralized. The posture itself is. come from 100, I mean 0 to at least 50% better. And then we started using the IM analyzer. We started cleaning up, still further improved. Regulatory compliance. We are meeting the regulatory compliance, as I said, we are cut across all the Industry So we have a lot of complaints uh to be met. We have a lot of certifications we. High trust, HIPAA, Sok everything we actually Ensure that we had to be compliance with those SOC2 example I said we cannot sign our um. Yearly announcement of our revenue. Unless it's a so approved, it has to be sock to approved, then only we can go and announce the results operational efficiency. And faster incident response, it's become very fast now, reduce leakage. That's major, major. Lesson learned Uh, if you are decentralized, a lot of sprawl. You can have a lot of sprawl of our identity and can lead to risk. Centralized, avoid rework and zero trust. Lot of visibility and enforcement, least privileged is a journey, not, not yet completed for us. I think it will take some more years for us to complete least, least privileged. I want to hand over to Jamia. Thank you all very much for attending. Please fill out session survey. Come see me tomorrow. I am 307.
