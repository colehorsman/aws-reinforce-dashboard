## Summary
This session presents AWS Managed Microsoft AD and how it helps enterprise customers manage identity in the cloud. Dennis Rothmill (Head of Product Management) and Vladimir Probrov (Principal Solutions Architect) discuss the challenges organizations face when migrating Active Directory to AWS, including complexity, disruption, and time consumption. They introduce AWS Directory Service's two main offerings: AD Connector (identity proxy) and AWS Managed Microsoft AD (fully managed domain in cloud). The session features a pre-announcement of a new capability allowing customers to extend their existing self-managed Active Directory domains with AWS-managed domain controllers, preserving existing domain admin credentials while gaining AWS native integrations.

## Key Points
- **Migration Challenges**: Active Directory migrations are complex, disruptive, time-consuming, and costly while often leaving customers with what they already had
- **Two Service Options**: AD Connector (identity proxy to on-premises AD) and AWS Managed Microsoft AD (new cloud domain with trust relationships)
- **New Capability Announced**: Extend existing self-managed Active Directory domains with AWS-managed domain controllers in AWS
- **Preserved Access**: Maintain existing domain admin credentials and management control while gaining AWS native integrations
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Single-tenant directory deployment across multiple AZs with scalable domain controllers
- **Native AWS Integration**: Seamless domain join for EC2, RDS databases, Amazon FSX with no deep AD permissions required for service owners
- **Cross-Account Sharing**: Share managed AD across multiple AWS accounts while maintaining security boundaries
- **Cloud Native Management**: Integration with CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Certificate Manager, Systems Manager, and AWS APIs/SDKs
- **Simplified Administration**: Manage users and groups through AWS Management Console, CLI, and SDKs without requiring PowerShell or traditional AD tools

## Technical Details
- **Deployment Architecture**: Single-tenant deployment across multiple AZs with minimum 2 domain controllers, scalable based on load requirements
- **Security Compliance**: Designed to be secure by default with PCI DSS and HIPAA compliance readiness
- **Multi-Region Support**: Extend directory across regions to be closer to users and workloads for cloud-scale infrastructure
- **Trust Relationships**: Support for creating trusts between on-premises AD and managed AD domains for hybrid scenarios
- **Application Integration**: Native integration with RDS (Oracle, SQL Server), Amazon FSX, EC2 automatic domain join, and other AWS services
- **Hybrid Extension Model**: New capability allows extending existing AD domains with AWS-managed domain controllers while preserving existing SIDs and ACLs
- **API-Driven Management**: Full CRUD operations for users and groups via AWS APIs, CLI, and SDKs in multiple programming languages
- **Monitoring Integration**: CloudTrail logging for administrative tasks, CloudWatch logs for security and performance metrics streaming
- **Certificate Management**: Integration with AWS Certificate Manager Private CA for issuing certificates without additional PKI servers
- **Cross-Trust Management**: Ability to manage objects across trust relationships through automated Lambda functions and CloudWatch events

Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Uh, I'm Dennis Rothmill, uh, head of product management for AWS Directory Service. Yeah, I'm Vladimir Probrov. I'm a principal solutions architect and product management team. Uh, and here today we're here to talk to you about AWS managed Microsoft AD and how we help enterprise customers with identity on, uh, in AWS. So, uh, first talk through a couple of key points, you know, what does Active Director mean for customers today, um, what, how's it relevant to them, etc. and then how does AWS directory service help, uh, enterprise customers or customers of actual directory dependencies with their journey to the cloud? Uh, after that we have a pre-announcement of a new capability with AWS manage Microsoft ID that we'll be happy to talk to you about today, uh, to help you support your hybrid or multi-cloud needs, and lastly we'll talk about how we take Active Directory, help you move it to the cloud, and make it part of the cloud with cloud native directory, uh, management capabilities. Uh, well, first things first, I think, uh, customers have invested significantly in Active Directory and on premise, uh, you know, in their data centers over the years and moving that. That investment to the cloud is non-trivial for a lot of customers. That's why you'll see popular quotes like Andy Jassi's here where large majorities of people's IT spend is still on premise because the act of moving to the cloud takes a bit of investment, takes a bit of planning, can be disruptive, and anything that you know can help with that, make it less disruptive is what customers are looking for support on. So when we talk to customers and directory service about some of the challenges they face when moving to the cloud, first and foremost, the ones that have done active directory migrations in the past of any kind will tell me the same things every time. It's complex. It can be disruptive to my end users and to my business. It's very time consuming and it can be costly. And at the end I'm left with what I already had before I migrated largely um so that can be something that doesn't necessarily always get prioritized uh you know funding for that can be difficult etc. so anything that customers can find that can help you know reduce or lower those barriers for them, uh, is a benefit when it comes to moving to the cloud, modernizing away from Active Directory, and etc. um, second, when moving to the cloud. All of the access to applications, workloads, resources from end points, you know, to the network all needs to be preserved. So when setting up Acive directory in the cloud as well as maintaining one on premise and linking those environments together and then moving workloads, there can't be disruption to end users access to the applications that they need to do their daily job so preserving that access is critical to having a successful move from on prem to the cloud. And lastly, Moving from active directory A to active directory B. Pushes you to have to do a name change to your environment which a name change might sound a little bit trivial, but then it's every application link every DNS, you know, full DNS name changes and then that can be impactful to end users service to service interactions, even just to the IT admins, uh, you know, hey, when did user X migrate to environment B which environment do I admin them in, uh, when I need to give them access to a new application or a different, you know, resource or shared folder. So all these challenges are, are things that people have to kind of plan for schedule around, invest time and energy and smoothing over these, these hurdles and these were bumps for their end users and so. How does the AWS directory service help customers with this journey, uh, to the cloud? Yeah, so, uh, what we've heard about, uh, active directory migrations, uh, and, uh, enterprise migrations to the cloud, uh, is, uh, That there is no one size fits all migration path for the customers. It all depends on uh customer needs, customer existence applications and workloads and existing infrastructures that they built uh on premises. Some customers just want to connect to AWS cloud and use uh some some cloud applications like Amazon Q for Business or just log into their AWSS accounts. Some customers want to move their specific applications or workloads into easy to infrastructure and run them in the cloud. And uh some customers uh are ready uh and see uh actually seeking for modernizing the whole infrastructure to become cloud native. In digital services, we have two subservices that help us, help help our customers to manage these needs. So we have AD connector, which actually uh acts like identity proxy. It follows all reification requests from the cloud applications uh uh to on-premises AD. And uh doesn't cache or store any information uh about uh these requests. So uh it's an easy way how to connect existing users from your active directory to AWS applications. And uh we have it was managed Microsoft ADU which is our primary topic today, uh, that actually deploys a new domain, uh, so new active directory domain in the cloud and allows you to, uh, uh, in addition to connection to applications and the accounts, it allows you to deploy uh EC2 instances and databases, uh, into these domains. So, let's dive deep. What is uh ES managed Microsoft AD? So It's a single tenant directory that we deploy in the cloud, so we don't share any infrastructure companies, any instances uh across, uh, our, uh, different customers. So it deployed just for you. Uh, we deployed in uh multiple availability zones, uh, to provide. Uh, protection from any problems with, uh, cloud infrastructure, uh, and reduce, uh, any risks caused by that. Uh, by default to deploy it with two domain controllers, but you can scale it out and deploy additional domain controllers for more, um. Heavily loaded environment. And it supports multi-region deployment, so you can extend it to be closer to your users, to your workloads to provide. Uh, really cloud scale infrastructure for your enterprise. We uh put a lot of effort to make uh this directory secure by default uh and uh ready to be compliant with uh PCIDSS and HIPAA and other industry and government regulations. And the typical deployment, uh, looks like uh our customers uh have deployed uh directors, so managed AD in the cloud, create a trust between their own premises infrastructure and uh managed AD domain, and use it to access EA applications and deploy new cloud services. Customers really like this uh pattern because it's easy to create some. Isolated environment for applications, uh, for deploying um some test, uh, scenarios for developers and uh for limiting uh blast radios uh to actually contain their cloud workloads into this protected environments. Yeah. Yeah, so customers are really happy with the way managed AD works today in that you know you have the ability to deploy workloads in the cloud using all AWS native constructs, so API calls, you know, directly from consoles of integrated apps you can select the managed AD and it will automatically domain join automatically be AD aware, and you can leverage those AD identities immediately within your RDS database server whether it be an RDS Oracle, Microsoft SQL, pick your favorite engine. Uh, or an Amazon FSX. So if you're, you know, dehydrating a local file server that you own or a NetApp file or something like that and moving into the cloud, you can do that while preserving all your, you know, AD related apples simply by selecting the directory and and deploying it automatically. And even the owner of say FSX or RDS doesn't need to have deep permissions to your active directory in order to do this integration. It's all done natively at the AWS layer and that's really great for many customers, um, so you know as we worked with customers over time. They said, hey, you know what, I love everything Manage AD is doing for me the blast radius, like the the AWS control plane level access to active directory, all these things are very powerful for me. The ability for me to delegate AD access to an application owner in a different AWS account while maintaining that they don't have direct access to AD. It's very powerful. Now can you help me and let me bring my existing AD into managed AD? And so today we're actually really delighted to announce, uh, after the team's hard work that we will, we will be supporting. Existing self-managed ADs and extending them with AWS managed Microsoft AD. So what this means in this scenario is previously today you can go into the console and deploy a net new brand new active directory, connect it to your existing directory with a trust. With this new uh edition of of managed Microsoft AD you'll be able to instead assess and extend your existing active directory with AWS providing you the servers, monitoring management, replacement, all the same things that we do for our manage AD directories, but for your domain controllers in AWS we'll do that for you. So this means, you know, when you tell us what VPC and what availability zones you want to be in, we'll deploy them when you need to scale out like Vladimir mentioned earlier, you tell us how many domain controllers we will add them. When you need to add additional regions, you select the region we'll deploy and let you extend and etc. all the same capabilities you're familiar with with managed Microsoft AD will be available now with your existing active directory. So now if you're, you know, running AD still in your data center, you may even have it running on virtual machines and other clouds, you'll be able to simply extend that AD directly into AWS and get all of our deep application integrations automatically, so your existing active directory. But with EC2 seamless domain join into that active directory, uh, with RDS databases you can now lift and shift a Microsoft SQL database from a self-managed Microsoft SQL server directly into an RDS SQL server. All the access control lists in that database are the same. It's the same SID, the same good, the same security identifier of user or Group A in your existing AD. And we're just providing you additional servers here in AWS um customers really like what we do with Manage AD, and they said, could you please help me out with my existing AD operations and this capability will help customers with that. What is also important is that you preserve all your existing domain admin credentials so you continue to manage your directory, you continue to manage your own premises or uh domain controllers deployed and other cloud providers. So you, you, you keep control under uh uh over this infrastructure, but, uh, we just provide you all the integration with AWS cloud and ability to manage AWS part of this infrastructure. So it's, it's kind of shared, uh, shared responsibility more between you and us. Yeah, definitely I think customers were looking for the automated capabilities we have for managing active directing and we're pleased to bring that to their existing directories today. And then across both your managed AD, you know, fully managed directories today and as well as your like hybrid managed directories in the future like I mentioned earlier, you can then take that directory that you've deployed in a single AWS account and share it across multiple accounts. So again what this lets you do is say application team comes to you and says, hey, I, I have an AWS account and that application that I'm putting in there. Needs access to active directory with the sharing feature you can simply enable a kind of object that represents your directory in a different AWS account and then they can do all those same seamless domain joints all the same application integrations that I mentioned earlier but across a separate account. So if you're you know implementing a multi-count strategy and you're working with a team of application owners in each. One has an has an uh account as their boundary um you'll be able to just, you know, simply enable AD access on a per application account owner basis uh that way again you don't have to give them direct access to AD. They can use the AWS native construct um you can even use some of our cloud native management tools to automate a lot of these capabilities, um, and so Vladimir, why don't you talk about how we, uh, help customers make AD a part of the cloud. Yeah, so, um, migration to the cloud is actually the first step into the, uh, in this journey. Uh, after that, uh, customers uh have questions about how to manage, uh, the active directory, how to make it, uh, a kind of cloud native service, uh, how to integrate it into existing AWS, uh, cloud operations and, uh, best practices. So we build uh integrations with uh all important uh security and operation services, uh, so. You can see your, um, managed AD and hybrid managed AD integrated with cloud trail. So all your administrative tasks, uh, by managing this uh a directory instance will be uh logged. We also stream all security and performance logs, uh, from performance metrics, uh, from the main controllers into cloud watch logs, so we can, uh, integrate it easily with, uh, any. Uh, actions or, um, security systems, uh, so that can be triggered by these events. Or for example, you can make a decision to deploy additional domain controllers if you, uh, see high CPU utilizations on your existing domain control uh domain controllers. We also made an integration with uh Edwards Privacy so we can issue certificates uh for your active direct infrastructure uh from uh Edwards Privacy without need to deploy additional PPI uh servers. And um Uh, you can use, uh, Ed Systems Manager, Fleet Manager to log into Windows EC2 instances uh with uh active directory credentials. So all of that makes, uh, this directory uh really a cloud, uh, integrated cloud, like a cloud, cloud native servers for you. And also, we integrated it with uh Ebus tools and SDKs and APIs. So, You can um manage your users, manage your groups uh uh in this active directory by using standard API or CLI tools so you can make it a part of uh deployment of your test environments or integrate into your DevOps processes. And also, we deployed uh managing users and groups just in Ed management console. So, uh, if you are a developer and you need to deploy just a test uh directory for your uh application, you don't, uh, need to become an AD admin. You can just deploy it, you can just create a few users and uh test your applications using that. So, uh, that actually makes it easier for integration with existing enterprise identity management processes or integration with HR systems and um Any uh identity life cycle management tools. Yeah, and just to make things a little bit simpler because of the fact these are all AWS native APIs you no longer need to, you know, build a AD domain joint Windows instance remote into that instance, start running PowerShell commands or open up the manual kind of, uh, out of the box admin tool kit to create users groups, manipulate them, etc. with this you can pick any language you like, you know, Python, etc. and our SDK automatically respects all that, right? So you don't have to become a PowerShell, you know, code author in order to be able to use this stuff. And you can also use it to uh manage objects across a trust. So a common example is customers, you know, implement manage AD connected to another AD. They create groups and are managed AD and they, they plug in their workloads to it, but they need to grab human users from a different active directory and put them in the groups they just created. You can do all that, you know, now via CLI. You can do it now automated lambda functions triggered off of cloud cloud watch events and stuff like that. So, um, so it's really powerful and and customers really happy with that. So, uh, look, with that, you know, we've been directory service you all have been awesome. uh, thank you very much for your time and your attention, and we'll be over here for questions if anyone has anyone. uh, thanks again. Thank you.
