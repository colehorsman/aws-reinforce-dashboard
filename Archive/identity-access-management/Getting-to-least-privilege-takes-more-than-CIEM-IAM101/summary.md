## Summary
This presentation focuses on the challenges of implementing least privilege access in AWS cloud environments. The speaker, Chris Edson from Tenable, emphasizes that achieving least privilege requires more than just Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) tools. 
The presentation highlights how cloud complexity has grown dramatically since AWS's launch (from 3 services to over 250), making security increasingly challenging. According to their research, 99% of cloud security issues stem from mismanaged identities and entitlements, making identity-centric security approaches crucial for modern cloud environments.

## Key Points
- Cloud's API-driven nature creates new security challenges, especially with infrastructure as code and automated deployments
- 82% of organizations are adopting multi-cloud strategies, increasing complexity
- There's a severe shortage of cloud security expertise, particularly in IAM roles
- Traditional vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning alone isn't sufficient
- Security teams are overwhelmed with too many issues to assess and remediate
- Developer focus on feature delivery often overshadows security considerations
- Identity management must be approached holistically, not just through CIEM tools

## Technical Details
- Original AWS Services (2006):
  - S3
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute)
  - SNS
- Current AWS landscape:
  - 250+ services
  - New services like SageMaker requiring additional security considerations
- Security Tools/Concepts:
  - CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management)
  - CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)
  - CNAP (Cloud Native Application Protection Platform)
- Infrastructure as Code tools:
  - Terraform
  - CloudFormation templates
- Security implementation methods:
  - Identity-centric approach
  - Privilege management
  - Resource access controls

Good morning, everybody. How's it going? Good, good, good, good. My name is Chris Edson. I'm with Tenable. I lead the global solution engineering team for cloud security. I can barely see anybody out there just cause these lights are blinding me. Um, we're almost at lunch, almost at lunch. Um, from a speaker perspective, I think it's actually better before lunch because the last couple of sessions I've done have been after lunch and um. I don't get a lot of engagement when folks have, you know, full bellies. So, thank you for being here. I really appreciate it. We're gonna be talking about least privilege, all things identity access within the cloud. And understanding that least privilege is this sort of holy grail that we as a security industry have been operating against for 30+ years now. And to truly reduce risk in the cloud, it's gonna take more than just understanding these privileges, understanding identity security in the cloud. There's a couple of different components to it, OK? OK, let's get this started. So, right on time actually. I'm not here to teach you how the cloud is different. Like everybody in this room understand how, understands how the cloud works. Um, but I think it is important to understand that the. That the way the cloud operates foundationally brings about challenges for security personnel, security practitioners. Because it's all just APIs. In order to deliver infrastructure. Set up, you know, terraform delivery pipelines, you have to have some sort of permission set. And with that, are phenomenal benefits to the business. That means I no longer have to open a ticket for Billy Bob to spin up a server for me anymore, right? I can simply hit an API. I can, you know, deploy out some terraform code, cloud formation templates, etc. and I get my infrastructure spun up immediately. But from a security standpoint, And there's a lot of conditions here that, you know, we, we need to be afraid of or need to be wary about, right? Because developers, and no offense to any dev heads in the room, but in my experience, developers are primarily concerned with feature delivery updates, etc. and less concerned with. Secure implementation of their code. So security is sort of always coming in after the fact. Trying to understand what's out there, what's being delivered, how it's configured, who has access to it, right? List goes on and on and on. Now, from a business standpoint, this is actually phenomenal. There's a ton, there's tons of um opportunities, but on the flip of that, there's a ton of threats. Mm. So, I talked about terraform. The accessibility to the cloud has never been easier, especially with things like infrastructures code. Everything is programmatically accessible now. Lots of teams involved, which is better because you talk about speed of delivery. Lots more folks have access to cloud infrastructure than legacy infrastructure. But again, on the flip of that, there's a ton of threats to the business that we have to understand as well. More hands in the cookie jar increases complexibility. Complexities. One of the things about delivering infrastructure via code is that it's highly susceptible to human error. And now I don't know if anybody has ever scanned a terraform configuration file or some sort of infrastructures code and seeing the mistakes configuration wise, it's a, it's an easy slip. And so given that, um, you know, we at Tenable believe that the only way to solve for securing challenges in the cloud is by evaluating all aspects from one approach. And that is going to be an identity-centric approach. But again, we're gonna highlight two specific areas here within this presentation. Everybody does vulnerabilities and every everybody, everybody does misconfigurations in the cloud, even if you're not a security company. You're doing CSPM. CSPM these days are a little bit sort of commoditized. But the specific things that we're gonna be talking about are privilege, excess privilege, and then on the flip, so it's two halves of one coin, right? Or two sides of one coin. You have who has access to who and what can access resources and what type of resources are they? What type of data is it? And all of that is in an effort to reduce the workload. On security teams, you have resources, security teams that have way too many vulnerabilities at patch, way too many misconfigurations to worry about. So let's focus on the right ones. And you're leveraging the identity as the context to power that prioritization. Again, I don't need to tell anybody in this room or anybody at this conference, for that matter, that securing the the cloud is incredibly challenging. There are 2, the things that we always hear, there are too many things to assess. There are too many issues, there's too much noise. There's not enough time to do it. There's not enough people to remediate it. The teams are small, they're siloed working teams. The list goes on and on and on. Point being, Securing the cloud is incredibly difficult, it's complex. New architectures and design patterns and attack vectors. Does anybody know how many services AWS started with in 2006? How much? 150. That's way higher. There was only 3 services. 3, S3 EC which is, well, it used to be called Elastic compute and then SNS. Does anybody know how many services AWS has now? Over 250. So think about that from a security standpoint. Every single reinforce and every single reinvent, there's a new service that they come out with or that another cloud provider, 82% of, of organizations are going multi-cloud. So developers go to reinvent and they come back and they say, hey, we want to take advantage of this new service so there's new AI services out there to do something for the business. Security is always like, I'm just getting a grasp of the workloads that I have running in the cloud. Now you're telling me I have to deal with Sagemaker? What is Sage maker? Right? So, That's the sort of thing that we're contending with. It's like a hockey stick or a Nike swoosh in terms of adoption of all these different services. So you take a, you take a look at that type of complexity. It's pretty tough. Tolling overload is important too, because if you guys go to the um Cloud Native Computing Foundation landscape and uh or the CNCF landscape, there are hundreds of security security only vendors for the most part. That are looking at cloud native applications, cloud native services, Kubernetes-based services. How are you supposed to tell from a security standpoint, which ones you need, which ones overlap, which ones are easy to use, which one can be adopted internally? It's incredibly difficult. So you see this sort of collapse of different use cases in the form of a cloud native application protection platform or CNAP. Shortage of expertise. I think everybody probably realizes this. I had a Fortune 500 CISO tell me a couple of months ago that they had an identity and access management principal architect for their cloud requisition open for over 18 months. It's incredibly difficult to find the right people with the right expertise to help cost effectively wise, help reduce and implement security practices within your programs. There is one reason and one reason only. That we at Tenable are so focused on identity and access management, and that is because of the stat here. According to our research, And there's other third-party research that sort of backs this up. It's within, you know, 90 to 99%. 99% of all issues in the cloud. Result from mismanaged entitlements or identities, period. If you're chasing vulnerabilities and you're chasing misconfigurations, and you're chasing sort of the runtime stuff or the developer, developer, the shift left focus, yes, it could be used as an initial access. But the root cause always comes back to identity, and I was joking with the CISO a few weeks ago. And he was like, you know, security vendors are really funny because marketing comes up with all these different terms all the time and it's like this new hot ticket item and there's a new name and a new buzz and a new industry term, but the kill chain hasn't changed in 25, 30 years. It's still the same, right? It's initial access, it's lateral movement, it's pri privilege escalation. It's persistence, and then it's exfiltrate data. That's basically what it is. And if you think about that, let me go back one time. If you think about that, initial access could be a vulnerability, it could be a misconfiguration. Could be an identity issue. Lateral movements identity, privilege escalation identity, persistence is identity, almost 4 of the 5 there besides Da XL are all related to identity. And it's no wonder why. No offense to AWS, but what is, what does this slide convey? This is just one service within AWS. What does it convey? Say what? Complexity, chaos. If you expect one person or a small team of folks to understand the net effective permissions of access across the cloud using this type of service. That's impossible. You have all different types of components. You've got the IM service. You've got resource-based policies. Oh, you, uh, you disabled KMS decrypt on your IM user. Well, guess what? KMS key policy has the decrypt for that IM user. That's a net effective permission. You have service control policies. Permissions boundaries, trust policies, you have um. What's the new one they just came out with in December? Resource control policies. So that's a resource control policy at the resource level that take, you need to take that into account when understanding net effective permission. And oh by the way, Azure is completely different and so is GCP. And that's just the IM components. Mm Incredibly challenging stuff. All the pictures and memes and whatnot that I have in this presentation are all literally from LinkedIn, because I, I love LinkedIn because I just think, you know, lots of security folks, practitioners, etc. are all up to date in terms of the things that they're sharing and the concepts they're sharing. And while some of them may be funny, they are all mostly true. So this one the other day, especially within the cloud. Obviously, you're gonna have a, you know, web application firewall for your application, your critical applications, but for the most part, The way that folks are adopting SAS based tools. Identity is gonna be your perimeter, right? Um, you can have the best network edge on the planet. And leave an unused. Credential or API key somewhere, and all of that network edge is for naught. Because it has excessive permissions or has access to a service. And then on the flip side, I like to make fun of vendors because we all say identity is the new perimeter, but it is kind of funny because it is true. Especially in the cloud. And these are just a list of like specific examples of how you manage identity and access, all the different controls, and it's probably not even exhaustive. Gets back to the complexity piece. Given that you need to understand identity and access management, how does that context enhance or decrease risk within the cloud? But oh, you have to deal with all this stuff, and then you got to deal with your identity provider federating access into the cloud. It's like we have a researcher at Tenable. We have a dedicated research team. It's like over 150 people that just look at vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and. You know, issues within the cloud, legacy, legacy, um, infrastructures. And he calls it the, uh, he actually discovered a vulnerability within Google Cloud. Um, he calls that sort of example the Jenga tower of access, because, you know, to their credit, cloud service provider, you know, does one thing, there's an API, then they're like, oh, we need to do something else, and they build on top of it, and they build on top of that, and they build on top of that, and they build on top of that, and one little piece and the whole tower falls down. And just more examples of, I mean, like, I, I said 99%, but it's really hard to find an example of a breach that doesn't, it's some portion of the kill chain involve an identity, where if that identity was mapped to least privilege or uh removed uh access was removed, that the breach could have at least been um eliminated or reduced from blast radius standpoint. Um, the, the one that's probably the most recent is the Oracle with the weak access credentials, which I don't know if Oracle is still denying or not, but it happened. And then, and then, uh, Midnight Blizzard. Um, we'll talk a little bit about that next. Uh, that was one that, that persisted for quite some time because they had an OA application. That they created based off of inactive credentials. And we're able to exfiltrate data. And actually just coming from Tenable, given that we have, I don't know, the best vulnerability database. Uh, over, I think it's over 200,000 vulnerability checks now. Um, we were one of the first to come, to come out with a log for J check. Password spray to find, actually, yeah, password spraying, it was a different one. So it was uh Onus incident, which is like a crypto market that leveraged the log for J vulnerability, just another example. That ended up getting into a API key, AWS credentials, had access to S3 bucket, full access, exfiltrated data, and then deleted all the buckets. Midnight blizzard, again, going after the shortest point between A and B is straight line, right? Like I'm gonna go after inactive accounts. I'm gonna go after unused accounts. I'm gonna go after excessive permissions. That's exactly what they did here. And just some more data points, right? Like there's this tech strong. survey which asked security leaders what's, what, what are the biggest security threats to your cloud environment and the top two responses are identity focused. Identity related breaches and excessive permissions. CIA came out with an advisory last year. It said threat actors are changing the way they gain initial access by simply going after inactive and unused accounts. Because it's that easy. So besides the complexity slides that I threw up there for you to convey chaos. Why is this such an issue? It's probably self-explanatory at this point, but we can talk about some of the pillars that we see in terms of why it's an issue. Poor visibility. Poor visibility is pretty self-explanatory. Um, and I'll talk a little bit about identity sprawl because it's kind of commingled here. But poor visibility, we don't have the right tools that are integrated into the right identity services that can present a relationship focused or identity focused. View on risk. Not to mention with the way that identities change. We are either delayed or coming in way after the fact with the current configuration of who has access to what and what can be done with that access. Identity sprawl is really interesting. Microsoft came out with their report last summer. I think it was last summer. Oh And they said the ratio of human to service accounts is 1:10. So for every human user, you got 10 more service accounts to deal with. Service accounts, while they are a little bit more predictable, they are identities. They do have access to workloads, they have access to services, they can do things, they can change things within the environment, and they are most likely excessively permissive. We talked about complexity. Again, uh, 75 to 82% of all organizations are going multi-cloud. So that complexity just builds on top of each other once you get into different paradigms of access across multi-cloud environment. Contextualization So you need contexts to drive that execution or remediation. Imagine if you were like, hey, developer guy, or site reliability guy, this role is overly permissive. And you need to reduce the privileges. And he's like, well, what what's overly permissive? What happens if I reduce those permissions to the application that it's depended upon or some other service downstream that it's dependent upon? And the security guys is like, I have no idea. So, you need to understand the context of how that identity relates to everything else running within the cloud. Are there vulnerabilities? What are the misconfigurations? What are the configurations? What is it mapped to? What is it related to? What is that identity supposed to be doing? We lack confidence as an industry on the context. Of identity and access management within the cloud. And then we've talked about insufficient expertise. It's um it's just incredibly difficult to find the right folks to be able to manage this stuff um at scale and Across a multi-cloud environment. I saw this on LinkedIn last week. Kevin Page is the CIO at um at conductor one, super smart guy. I know there's some missing contacts here, so I'm gonna sort of quote it out for you. So basically saying, he says, quote, least privilege is great in theory. It sounds great, but in today's environments with SAS, IA, PAS, on-prem, and zero standardization across identity or access patterns, it is a fantasy. Worse, it creates a distraction. Teams get so focused on achieving zero or at least privilege that they make decisions that slow down the business and actually increase risk, end quote. And his sort of. What he's postulating here is that zero standing privileges and access just in time when they need it is the way forward. Do folks generally agree with this, Hans? OK. So, I also agree with it, with two caveats. Least privilege is not very good for human users. I think everybody in this room can probably agree with that. It's too dynamic. I have way too many changes in the environment. The time that I implement least privileged for this person, their needs change in the next week. It's impossible to keep up with. So you need these privilege for at least service identities. Cause those are way more repeatable, predictable. Access levels. And then the second caveat here is just in time, in my opinion, is not a feature functionality capability. Yes, well, while there are vendors including Tenbolt that has a just in time feature functionality capability, it's way more than that. Um, you always have three things. You got people process, people process slash policy, and then technology. So the technology is covered, you need the people to process piece to actually be successful in implementing. We just um implemented 13,000 developer just in time at a very large financial organization and we had to get buy-in. At the very top, to start implementing a just in time sort of culture across the organization. It needs a phenomenal user experience and the engineers, cause typically it's not cloud security or security practitioners requesting access here. It's developers, it's site reliability, it's cloud architects. They need to come to you and say I love actually doing just in time. It makes me feel better because it's easy to use, it makes me feel better because there's a security sort of condition to it. It's reviewed, it's audited, it's very quick. It doesn't get in my way of doing anything. It's immediate. I get approval right away or I get auto approved. It's gotta be super easy to use. And these are the two components that we're dealing with, right? Service identity sort of includes that non-human identity aspect, your API keys, those types of things. API keys typically have some sort of. You know, permission policy associated with it. Again, service accounts are consistent. They're more predictable. They're much more aligned to right sizing permission sets. For cloud access for different workloads, services that need access human identities again, impossible, unpredictable. Hard to write size and even sometimes, I don't know about you folks, but I've been in a situation where I've wanted to rip my hair out because somebody comes to me and says, I need access to, you know, XYZ service within AWS. OK. I just assigned a policy to you. You're good to go. Um, actually, it's not working. I'm getting a 403. OK. Well, let me check again. Let me add some conditions or remove some conditions. OK, it should be working. Still getting a 403 access denied and then you start to think about that complexity slide. What component or variable is in line of access that's reducing my net effect of permission to not allow me, not allow the guy, the person asking the requester access to the service? It's incredibly difficult and frustrating. So then I just go, you know what, have admin. I'll remove it later. And later never happens. So the The recommendation here. Is to leverage at least privilege for service accounts, non-human identities. But do it on actually used historically used activity. You can't you need to be able to, that's the important thing like when you look at a just in time or an IGA provider, they're not really built for the cloud, they're built for identity, but they're not really built for the cloud, so you miss all that context of maybe historical access. And then for human users, gotta jump on the, the, the just in time hype train. OK. So let's take a look at how this sort of solution works and we're at Booth's, I think it's 617 if you guys want to actually see it in person. I even have like a little recording here that I'll show you as well. Again, We manage Short term permissions for the cloud. This is a multi-cloud, multi-cloud as well as Saba applications. So it's really cool because the user experience is so fire that people have asked us to implement for other things beyond cloud infrastructure because the adoption has been increasing so significantly. OK, the top sort of person icon here is the requester. Pretend that's somebody coming in and saying, I need access to do some maintenance on an RDS instance, relational database service, right? So they sign in to their, through their IDP 99% of organizations federate through an IDP. And they have access immediately to AWS or another cloud, right? But they don't have access to RDS because they are. No standing access by default, right? That, that would be the goal. So, through Slack or through Teams or some sort of other medium of chat ops, they say, hey, I need access to this relational database eligibility. That is notifying our 2nd person icon at the bottom, which is our approver user. They say Approve that request. Tenable cloud Security manages just in time permissions within the multi-cloud or SASS-based environment through I uh IDP uh group uh management. All the notifications, downstream integrations, all that stuff is integrated through email, Slack teams, etc. and then the original requester, assuming approved, has access for that period of time and then it's immediately revoked once the original time has, has, um, elapsed. So if they requested for 2 hours, 2 hours, we remove the, the, uh, eligibility. OK, and so here's a quick little overview. Let's see if my iMovie skills are put to the test. OK, the requesting user has no standing privileges to AWS as you can see here. Now we're an admin creating a dynamo DB read-only eligibility that people can request and approve. We're picking the user who can request this. Anybody in the engineering team, we support groups. Which policy can they request? AWS read only or Dynamo DB read only. What accounts can they request? And who's approving? Oh, the site reliability engineering team. No justification required, although I have it as optional. Great eligibility is done in Slack, the requesting user again, seamlessly integrated into their workflow, selects what eligibility they want, which accounts they want, how long they want it, and they give a just or they they give a justification. That's been sent to the approver. Now, let's pop over to the approver. Let's approve that in line with what our daily operations look like without having to log into the console. And now we have access as the requester to Dynamo DB service. Everything else is access tonight except for. Then he be. Maybe 2 hours went by. The approver says, I accidentally approved it. I'm gonna go into the request and revoke their requests, and within a matter of seconds, the requester refreshes and you get an error. No more access. That's what I'm talking about when it's more than just technology, it's process has to be easy. Has to be seamless, it has to integrate into. If you cause any strife or any extension of a request, you're gonna get pushback from a security standpoint. From the business. And this isn't just me or tenable saying this. If you go to the Identity Security Alliance, you're gonna be given these pillars. Here's how you implement best practice for access within the cloud, and we do all of these. Pretty phenomenally if I might add. And while I would, while they technically say, man, um, implementing a just in time program is. Under the advanced. And less of a beginner intermediate. I think it's something you've really got to start baking into the organization early on. You gotta start changing the culture to zero standing privileges by default with access just in time. Again, it's a journey, so not everybody's gonna get there right away, but you gotta start laying the sort of the red carpet out for just in time. OK. So we've talked about excessive privileges, we've talked about unused access, access in general, of course. We've talked about implementing just in time. Least privileged, you know, when it makes sense for. Nonhuman or service accounts. But there's something missing in this equation. And it's important because especially in the cloud. Everything is connected because it's just all APIs, right? So when you look at how access sort of leads to maybe sensitive information or resources or data or different services, it's all APIs. That's what makes implementing cloud security from an identity first approach that much more important. Because Even if you have a private bucket that is configured appropriately. You can still get from a vulnerability or a misconfiguration to a role that has privilege to that specific sensitive information. That can then exfiltrate data. So you might be OK on the misconfiguration side. But you're not OK potentially on the access side. That's why it's important. So thinking about access, right sizing, least privileged, just in time, can anyone think or shout out what we think the. Missing piece to this equation is. Yes. Yes. Sure. So, um, yeah, yes, I would say that's still in the same domain as identity and access management, and when you look at like implementing just in time, you need to have multiple layers of approval. Absolutely. Because depending on the eligibility, it could be a higher sensitive environment, right? And you might need 23456 different people to review that and audit that that approval request. But talking about a different domain outside of identity and access management, anyone else have an idea? Say it. I can't hear you. Roll-based access. That's still an identity and access management. Identity and access management is the main piece of the equation. I'll give it to you guys. Data Data Here's data. Um, Data security. Why Well, Because almost every single breach, while it does include identity. They're removing or exfiltrating data as part of that kill chain, almost every single one. Securing data is incredibly complicated. It's everywhere. There's different storage mediums, there's different services, there's different technologies. It's incredibly fun, incredibly difficult difficult to find what type of data is out there, who has access to it, and how it's configured, and what the risks are associated with it. Again, data breaches are still an issue. It is incredibly difficult to figure out if there are active threats or preventative threats to your data because you don't understand what type of data is out there. And current solutions are historically, if you look at data security solutions, there's some really good ones that are historically looking at data. The problem with that is, with this sort of adoption in the cloud. Especially within the artificial intelligence sort of era here. They are not purpose-built for cloud and vice versa. Cloud security solutions are not purpose built for data. So there's this sort of gap when you look at how can we understand the full equation of identity and access management and what type of data they're trying to access. Artificial intelligence complicates this, right? This is from a report from TALES, the TALES Dare report 2025. It just came out recently. Uh, in the, in the era of AI data security takes center stage. Obviously, that's Um, probably self-explanatory, right? AI is powered by data. Folks are organizations are racing to build their own models and pulling in data and leveraging data. So according to that report, 1 in 3 organizations are already integrating and transforming their operations with Gen AI. And security, unfortunately for us is always behind the curve. We're coming in after the fact, the wild wild west. Business demands will always lead. Security is going to follow. And security leaders are mostly concerned with data integrity. And trustworthiness. So if the data is powering. Business Through artificial intelligence, are we confident that we're protecting the integrity of the data that's powering those different models and those different services that we're creating for our customers? It's always been the same sort of issue, but AI is pouring of gasoline on that fire and making it way worse. And then you have quantum computing, and I promise this all sort of makes sense here. It's all from that in that initial data security report. I had a CIS so tell me, I'm not even joking you. I'm not worried about my data security because it's all encrypted. OK, well. Quantum computing is gonna decrypt your data in like a matter of seconds or minutes, right? Like. That's the goal. So are you confident that your data is identified, classified, inventory, protected before you have to rely on encryption as your last. Secure resort. So what is it? How does it relate to access and privilege? Again, there are two sides of a single coin identity and access management and the security. Who has access to what and what can be done with the access? What type of data are they accessing? You need to shore up data in line with shoring up identity and access management. Ask yourself, where is the data? What is the data? Is it sensitive? Is it confidential? Is it restricted? Is it non-sensitive? Who has access to it? Who uses the data? That's your identity and access component. That's probably a really important piece. And how can we actually reduce the risk? What are the configurations or rights or access or at least privileges that we can implement to help reduce a blast radius of accessing this data, secure or not? OK, let's talk about how, and again, back to the same sort of common theme, identity-centric approach to securing your cloud includes Understanding access and understanding what type of data is out there. Start with discovery. Figure out where it lives, connect the dots. You can't protect what you can't see, right? That's pretty straightforward. Start to classify it. You need to know what type of data is out there because if you are worried about prioritizing, protecting Tracy's and accounting favorite song lists from Spotify. Then you're probably not worried about the right type of data in your environment. Understand access. And again, this is the important part, right? Because you're, you're starting to blend the lines in terms of access, identity management. And data security. Start to identify risks. Now, this is more than just excessive permissions. This comes, this this is the sort of um uh reducing the security gaps or gaps or threats around that data like misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and all the different sort of variables that go into. Initial access or downstream access. And then again we talked about context. Context is the context is the piece that I think is so important because again, nobody in this room needs any more alerts, so we need to leverage our ability to pull in additional context, primarily around access. To make sure we're reducing and understanding. Where we should remediate and spend remediation efforts. And if we circle back to this slide from earlier, this is our sort of charter. You know, from a tenable cloud security perspective, we're reducing risk in the cloud by focusing first on Anybody? Identity, yes. And the net effect of permissions across the cloud while discovering, inventorying, classifying. Data in the cloud. And so we, we look at it, removing excessive permissions, locking down the data, reducing exposure on effort to reduce workload. If you're taking that sort of vantage perspective or vantage point. The amount of vulnerabilities you have to fix and the amount of misconfigurations goes way down. Yes, you're gonna have reds and oranges and stuff like that on your dashboard, sure. But it's not going to carry risks to it, or if the risk is carrying with it is going to be significantly lower. Um, then making sure that you're spending time on the right things. One of my favorite things, I, I like to talk about outcomes. I don't, I mean, we are probably going to be, when you guys go to the Expo Center, we're gonna be talking about features and functionality and green buttons and blue buttons and this and that and sharing and PDFs and all that kind of stuff. But when it comes to Actual outcomes. These are specific things that I ask my customers. To think about Like how How confident are you that you can review every single entitlement for every single user and every single identity, for every single resource across a multi-cloud environment? I never ever get a hand. Never. Because it's hard. I mean, it's, it's, it's impossible and people are not confident with the tools that they already have that they can actually do that. And we just talked about 99% of all issues in the cloud result from that kind of thing. Are you confident that you know every single 3 is this sort of supply chain era? Are you confident that you know of every single third party access to your cloud environment, what they're doing and what type of data they have access to? And then of course, I mean, a couple other things here about protecting data. Can you inventory? Can you classify? Can you figure out what's out there? What type of data is related to access? What's the risk associated with it? Can you answer those questions? OK. So you guys are gonna get a couple of minutes back in your day cause there's no way I'm gonna take up the full hour, but To leave you with just a few recommendations here, and this is not gonna be anything new. This is gonna be the same sort of thing that I've been talking about the whole talk here. Start with. Identity first built for the cloud. I say built for the cloud. Because when you look at legacy IGA providers, it's total square peg round hole, right? You're just kind of mushing things together. You need to have expertise in understanding access to the cloud because it's a completely different paradigm than it is for legacy solutions. Start with identity first. Get on board this just in time hype train. The only thing stopping implementing adjust in time or at least adopting it, again, is people and policy within the organization. If the solution is a world-class user experience, it integrates seamlessly. People like to use it. There's no reason why every organization shouldn't have at least had the conversation. To implement just in time program. We did it here at Tenable for our internal security, so everything that I request access to as an employee, I open up Slack. Uh, assuming it has some sort of security component to it, like I can get into my HR systems, no problem, um, without just in time. I open up Slack, cause that's what we use for our chat apps. I hit forward slash tenable legit. I ask for requests, gets approved, and I'm immediately within the application or the cloud infrastructure. And finally, Data is your sort of key prioritization component here. So all things being equal when you look at the kill chain. If you have the same vulnerability and the same misconfiguration and the same access problem, but again, one leads to your favorite Spotify playlist and another leads to sensitive patient records. If you're not looking at data, then you might treat those two. Kill chains or, or, or issues as the same in terms of prioritization, but if you're looking at the data. As another variable. Then you understand that one needs to be treated a lot higher than the other. So again, my name is Chris Edson. Find me on LinkedIn, Global, uh, solutions architect leader here at Tenable Focus on cloud security. We're doing a really cool custom hat bar at Tenable. We have a huge booth. It's like a 30 by 30, right, uh, sort of at the entrance and exit within the expo. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, criticisms, whatever you want, you want to talk about identity in the cloud, come talk to us, come meet me. It's a pleasure. I hope you guys have a great time in Philadelphia and enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you very much.
