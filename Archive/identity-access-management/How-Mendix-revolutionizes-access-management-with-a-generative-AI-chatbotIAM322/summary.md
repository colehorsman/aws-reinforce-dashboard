Great Thank you for coming here to listen to us. We have a very interesting topic lined up today. Managing access at scale. is a significant challenge for most of the enterprises. Straining IT resources, creating bottlenecks. And frustration for both the user and the central IT team. My name is Sachin. I'm a senior delivery consultant part of AWS Professional Services, and with me I have Karra. He's my co-presenter. He's a senior software engineer from Mendix Cloud Center of Excellence team. And today we're going to talk about how Mendix revolutionized access management with the generative VI chatbot. This solution, uh, developed collaboratively between AWS Pro Server and Mendex CCI team. Has enhanced the user experience and increased the efficiency of the Mendex CCIT. In the agenda today, uh, we will look at the, we'll see what problems we were trying to resolve, and, uh, we'll look at Mendic use case, followed by the overview of the solution that we've created. And we'll see the chatbot in action in the demo section. And then we'll dive deep into the chatbot architecture and see what are the components we used to implement it. Uh, and finally some of the key takeaways. With this, I now hand it over to Kera to talk about Mendix and the use case over to you. Thank you, Sachin. Uh, I. Um, so let me first tell you a bit about Mendix. So Mendix is a local application development platform founded in 2005 in Netherlands. And after We were acquired by Siemens in 2018 as a key part of their one tech company strategy. We at Mendex empower everyone from business users to professional developers to build better software faster. By providing a comprehensive, powerful platform, which supports every step of the application life cycle, from ideation, development, to deployment and operation. While providing the tools. Likes of collaboration, project management, and also governance. So Our commitment to quality and innovation and speed is the very reason why we have been recognized as a garden leader. You can see us sitting in the top right hand corner since 2017 consistently. We have a diverse set of offerings and our product portfolio and public platform being the most popular. Our public platform is hosted in 17 AWS regions and growing. And spans across more than 170+ accounts in different environments. We used AAS control tower to manage our account landing zone, ensuring proper governance. But when it comes to Access management, it, it is more distributed, with more than 50 teams managing access to their own accounts. That's where our story begins today. After controlled our migration, all the accounts under one organization. But some of the teams were accessing using direct IM users, which means different user credentials for each and every account for IM users. And most of the teams are managing using a centralized IM approach, where users logging into a central hub account, and from there they are assuming, assuming roles to target accounts. Because there are lots of accounts and roles involved, they have to more often relied upon. Third party browser extensions and last but not least, Some of the teams are using directco Federation, connecting their accounts directly into our identity provider. So, all these Sorry, sorry, uh, so all these methods were implemented differently slightly by different teams, creating key challenges for the users, especially who are already juggling with different user credentials. On top of that, from central perspective, center of excellency, and couldn't see who had what level of access to which resources, which created a lot of identity problems for us. And we are heavily relying upon security and compliance. So when it came to a security audit, it became a compliance nightmare. So we thought we need to completely change this approach because as Amy mentioned in the keynote, we give prominence to identity. Uh, access management when it comes to a foundational insecurity architecture. So we decided upon changing into a centralized approach, leveraging Microsoft ERD for authentication and AWS IM identity Center for access control. They are a key aspect to it. One thing being principle of least privileged access, which is very important. So we thought we wanted to enable the engineering teams to manage their own access to their accounts because they are the ones who are working on a day to day basis and being our environments are dynamic and we adopt a lot of AWS services when they are released and new services come in, they can first. So. We wanted to ensure principle of least privilege, as well as for us as central team, we want to ensure all the steps in the workflow was governed properly and also college checks in place, and could be auditable with better traceability. So we introduced a central git repository, uh, which each team's managing a dedicated team file with respect to their accounts they manage. And once the user commit, come and commit their permissions, it flows through the uh different uh designated team approvers, and once it was approved, the pipeline provisions access through identity center. This worked well for us because it brings the best in both worlds. We are teams able to utilize the power of self-service provisioning with agility and speed. And while a central team, we could enforce the governance. Having a strong governance structure with short-lived credentials, ensuring principle of this privilege. But when it comes to a transformation like this, it had its own challenges for us. As I mentioned earlier, Our work flow is based on jit. Which users need to have some level of understanding. When it comes to our technical teams, it was, uh, fine to work with them, but some of the teams really struggle with that. Because let's take a typical example. Imagine a business user or a colleague from our finance department needing access to AWS resource. So they first had to request uh access to repository, and then. They have to go and clone the repository and create a new branch, and commit the JSN object relevant to their permissions with the right permission sets, and then create a merch request. Once they do that, if there was any error. In how they did it, they had to dig through the pipeline, find the error, and redo the entire process. Uh this was. Already lengthy process and it also became a frustrating user experience. So, and users didn't have a clear way to see how the request was was, whether they got approved or not. So. The impact also felt on the CCA team who had to Um, hand hold the teams. While through the process and Also, there was recurring requests coming thick and fast into our Slack channels and also team channels. So that's why we think that we need to innovative this approach and provide a better user experience for the users. That's why we brought up on a generative AI chatbot. Keeping our back end, but now the users having to work with a generative AI chatbot rather than going through the complex jet operations. And this significantly simplified the access management for us. So now it's time for us to see how it really works in our environment. What are you searching? Thanks a lot, Keish. Now let's look at the chatbot in action in the demo section. So what we're trying to do is, uh, may make a typical user journey. So the user wants to provision access or they want to access an account. So the first thing they do is go to the AWS access portal, as you can see over here, and they are looking to access an account called observability. Uh, as you know, it's not showing up here because the user does not have access to it. Uh, so, Then, um, they go to the chatbot, start interacting with it, uh, with a simple message, and the chatbot, uh, sends a response. It introduces itself and it asks the user to provide three inputs AWSS account ID, single or multiple account ID on which they want access. The name of the permission set and the principal name of the identity information, if it is an email, uh, if it is a, um, user, then email address of the user, or if it is a group, then the name of the group. Uh, the user can provide, uh, the input in multiple set of messages, uh, but they can also provide all of the input and, uh, the chatbot will then process the request. Uh, moving further here, um. Now, the user is providing, uh, the input test pro uh they are providing the, uh, account ID. Some of the information is masked here for confidentiality, but you will be able to see the, uh, end to end chatbot interaction and the workflow. Uh, so the chatbot then, uh, acknowledges that it has received the account ID and it is, uh, asking the user to provide the further missing information. Uh, now the user is not sure of which permission set to use, so they are providing, uh, the use case of, uh, they, they want to check the billing reports and create some budget alert, and they're asking the chat board to provide some recommendation, uh, in terms of using some of the permission set. So the chatbot, uh, goes to the back end and analyze the use case that the user has provided and it will check the pre-created permission set that it has access to and. Uh, it will then try to provide recommendation to the user to use some of the permission set that, uh, that the user can use, depending on the use case provided. Uh, so now it has provided the recommendation. It's called Global billing permission set, and it has listed down the actions which are allowed as part of the global billing permission set. Now it is asking the user to confirm whether they would like to go with this, uh, recommended permission set. User can reject this recommendation or they can provide, um, further context on the use case and then that will provide, uh, uh, the chatbot will then provide a better recommendation depending on the uh. Depending on the context, of course. Um, so here, the user is OK with the recommended permission set, and uh they're then providing the group information or principal information. The chatbot goes and then validates all of the information and it has provided the response that the identity information or the principal information provided is not valid. It is, it does not exist. So this showcases that we're providing early feedback to the user and if you, uh, relate to the challenges described by QA earlier, uh, we are so earlier they had scattered feedback loops, so we are providing all the feedback and as early as possible, uh, in the, in the similar user interface. The user can, uh, chat with it using natural language and know more about the issues. It can also provide uh help to the user to resolve any errors as well. um, and the chatbot is also equipped with mandatory internal sources so it can point to the right team if it, if it does not have the answer to, to some of the. Um, some of the question, but, uh, in summary, it helps the user to troubleshoot the error and the user can also, uh, uh, ask technical question about the errors as well. Now, but in this case, the user realized there is a typo in the, uh, identity information. They provided the right identity or principal name, chatbot then validates again. This time the validation is successful, and it has also checked the uh duplicate assignment, um, with the provided input and everything seems to be sorted here. Um, finally, it asks for a final confirmation to the user. Uh, user provided the, um, confirmation and then it goes in the backing and it interacts with the external CICD system. Uh, and it has created the merge request and you can see the, uh, as part of the, uh, response it has provided the merge request URL and it is also listed down the approvers with whom the request is pending. Um, we are also providing all sort of guidance to the approver in terms of, uh, the requested details and all the metadata, so it will help the, uh, approval to, uh, provide an informed or take an informed decision. Moving a bit ahead here, but in a normal situation, the approval will get notification, they will take an action on the, on the request. Uh Moving a bit forward. And here after the request is approved, as you can see in the last message, the user gets the notification uh that the request is processed, and it also provides instruction on how to log into the account. User then goes um back to the access portal um and now they have access to the observability account and the permission set is assigned which was recommended by the by the chatbot and the user can then click on the permission set and they can access the account. So that's how the end to end access management process works. Let's now look at the different components which makes this, this possible. So, as you can see, the user has interacted with the user interface. So um we are using a Slack application dedicated for this. The reason of choosing something like Slack is this is this is the internal collaboration tool used within Mendex, so we wanted to provide a seamless user experience and, uh, the, uh, there's a dedicated application created for this and it is added to Mendix workspace. So anyone who wants to access the chatbot, they need to be authenticated by Mendix corporate identity, and they can directly then interact with the application or they can invite the Slack app to some of the private standards that they might have for the team. For each message sent, uh, Slack application signs the HTTP request and it invokes an Amazon API gateway. Uh, which then triggers an integration lambda. The responsibility of the integration lambda is to validate whether the, uh, input is really coming from Slack. And for that, it uses the same signature which is used by Slack application, um, while invoking the API gateway. And once it validates, once the validation is successful, uh, it then invokes bedrock agent by wrapping the input provided by the user in an API call. We are using Amazon Bedrock agent to orchestrate between different components. Um, and fetch the response from the input provided by the user. But before it goes and constitute a response, we are making it pass through a filtering stage where we're using Amazon Bedrock guardrail. We are filtering out undesirable or harmful content. It also provides, uh, safeguards against, uh, prompt injection attack. And to enhance the response we're using a rag-based approach, using uh knowledge base and we're using Amazon Aurora as a vector database. Uh, and different, uh, manic internal sources are connected. Um, and this is where the recommendation engine, as you mentioned, as you can see in the, as you've seen in the previous section, this is how the recommendation engine is providing better recommendation in terms of choosing the permission set. It also has um. It also has a different uh agent actions configured in, in the form of lambda function. And uh this is where it is, uh, interacting with internal APIs, internal AWS APIs like organization to validate the account, whether it is part of organization. Whether the account is active, uh, and the other set of input like, uh, principal information and, uh, permission set, it is, uh, calling the identity center API to, to check, uh, whether all of the input is, is valid. And it also as part of the agent action interacts with the CICD system and creates all of the merge requests adhering to uh the branching guidelines provided by the CCA team. Um, and once um all of these is done, we're also, um. We're also storing some of the metadata in Dynamo DB table. The metadata includes the requested details, um, the response from the CICD system. Uh, so we're using this information to, uh, send notification to the user and also can be used for audit purpose. Um, so the integration lambda, uh, as I mentioned, calls the Amazon Bedrock agent API. It's a synchronous API call. So the lambda waits for response from the Bedrock agent. Once Bedrock agent has the response, and then, uh, the lambda fetches it, parses it, and sends it back to the, uh, user via API call, and that's how the user gets a response. Uh, so this process is and workflow is, uh, done for all of the messages sent by the user. We achieved uh some great results with this 90% reduction in time taken to provision access, 95% increase in assess or adoption within Mendex. But what I want to emphasize here is some of the key takeaways that, uh, we learned while implementing this solution. We all know that generative AI system, uh, can generate highly realistic content, text, images and videos, but it can also generate outputs which seems plausible but are verifiably inaccurate. Uh, for that, incorporating human judgment becomes crucial, and if you're dealing with sensitive topic like access management, um, that really becomes critical. So we deliberately wanted to put the decision making to humans in the form of approval. So it has to go through an approval and then approval will get all the feedback from the gender AI system. They can then take an informed decision, as I, as I mentioned earlier. The other thing which we contemplated a little bit is, uh, centralized versus distributed approval model as Cara mentioned, they wanted to. Uh, promote self-service, um, so distributed approval model is something which was sort of a straightforward decision, uh, in the case of Mendex, uh, and we also wanted to separate the identity and access management. Identity management is being taken care of by the central identity team and access management is being then, uh, taken care of by the application owner, account owners which so that follows a distributed approval model. But uh if the organization has the need to configure centralized approval model, that can be configured as well with the central security team or uh CCA team taking decision in that, in that case. We also wanted to use the sheer scaling in which gender TBI system function, uh, as you've seen in the in the demo, we're supporting account assignment in bulk and that's what we observed, um, in multiple application team uses a lot of different accounts spread across different environments, so they want the access to be configured, uh, in bulk. So, uh, the chatbot supports that and the use case then can then be expanded into supporting the organization unit because a lot of enterprises use this organization and the. Uh, have the accounts as part of the, uh, as part of the OU. So given the, uh, input as the OU ID, the chatbot, uh, can then go and, and deconstruct and get the list of accounts and then it can provision access to that account. Um, and not just access management, uh, the CCO team is evaluating multiple other options as well, which will help them release some of the bandwidth and, uh, so they can focus on critical activities which brings business value to Mendex. Um, that's about it from our side. Thank you for listening to us. Um, please complete the session survey in the mobile application, and, uh, if you have any questions, um, please feel free to reach out. Thanks a lot.
