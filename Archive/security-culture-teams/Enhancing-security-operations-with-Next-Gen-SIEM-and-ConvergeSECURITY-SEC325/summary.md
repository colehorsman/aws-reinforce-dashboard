## Summary
In this talk, Stanley Parrott, a detection engineer at Deloitte, reflects on the evolution of SIEM and SOC operations over the past two decades. He discusses how traditional tools operated in isolation and why early SIEM implementations failed to deliver meaningful results due to a lack of context and data strategy. Parrott outlines the architecture of a Next-Gen SIEM platform, emphasizing the need for clear telemetry domains, a centralized data platform, and strong relationships between hot (learning interface) and cold (data lake) storage. He stresses that automation and AI are only as effective as the tradecraft behind them and shares insights on how observability and security analytics can drive deeper operational visibility and proactive detection. The session closes with a look at Deloitte’s partnership with AWS via ConvergeSECURITY.

## Key Points
- Early SIEMs suffered from information overload and lacked actionable context.
- Tools without tradecraft lead to "automated chaos"; effective automation starts with process maturity.
- Next-Gen SIEM architecture focuses on:
  - Asset and telemetry domain visibility (identity, endpoint, network, etc.)
  - Security data platform with ETL, learning interface (hot), and data lake (cold)
  - Integrations with APIs, direct access for data science, observability use cases, and AI model training
- Data lakes are foundational to modern detection and response—“better to have and not need.”
- Observability becomes a key security asset, enabling teams to ask and answer “why” across systems.
- ConvergeSECURITY is Deloitte’s joint framework with AWS to deliver this security architecture.

## Technical Details
- ETL pipelines (e.g., Kafka) are central for transforming and routing telemetry across systems.
- Hot storage (“learning interface”) supports fast SOC queries; cold storage (“data lake”) enables cost-effective retention and large-scale analysis.
- Telemetry domains are used to break asset visibility into manageable and queryable units.
- API-driven access supports data science workflows without impacting operational systems.
- AI/ML models require access to accurate and complete data sets; hallucinations and misfires stem from incomplete telemetry.
- Real-time detections include examples like monitoring for unauthorized identity creation outside of approved provisioning workflows.

Good afternoon everybody. Uh, as Jay said, my name is Stanley Parrott. I'm a detection engineer at Deloitte, so I write code to catch bad guys, um. Uh, objective of most security organizations is to make nothing happen. It's the reason why I put it on my t-shirt. Um, if nothing happens, then you're doing good. If a little bit happens, then you're doing OK, and then if a bunch happens, then it's gonna be a bad day for everybody. Um, so we got about 20 minutes. Um, I wanna talk to the history and kind of like where we are in SIM and SOC operations today. Um, or where we were, then we're gonna talk about where we are and then we're gonna talk about where we're gonna go. So I'm gonna cover 20 years of history and solve all of your security problems in 18 minutes and 37 seconds, OK? So let's go to work, um. At the turn of the century, because we can say that now, uh, at the turn of the century security was really a game of whack a mole with the threat actor, right? And the security products that were out there were all very segmented. They did their thing and they did their own and that's all they did, right? So you had your AV and it had this big. Long list of signatures and every time a process or a binary was ran it would bump it against that list of signatures and if the hash matched then it was bad and you killed it and that was all it was and it was this huge arms race to who had the longest signature list right? um and so and and I used AVs there but. Your your firewall was the same thing. Passwords being locked out was a similar thing if there was even a lockout policy, but tools really were just like, hey, I'm gonna protect an endpoint. I'm gonna protect the a network device, and that was it. And then we also had this weird situation where. We had these tools they did a lot of things, but it didn't connect any information and so we had the first advent of a SIM, right? And whatever that meant and so it was like, hey, we wanna put all of these things in a single place and so we tried to do that but the problem there is we have all of this stuff and it was kind of like when the dog chases the car it's like if the dog ever caught the car it wouldn't know what to do with it. Um, there wasn't a lot of contextual information added to it and then on top of all of that, once all the data was in our SIM, we're like, you know what we need to do? We need to tell the SIM what all the bad things are. So I'm gonna take this tip and I'm gonna dump it into my SIM and it's all gonna magically work and and that was right around the like tips started getting really popular around 1213, 140, um, and then once that happened. Everybody in the sock, do we have er do I have any operators like people that were working in the sock at that point in time? Just me? OK, um, what happened at that point in time was your SIM, your alert mechanism would go bananas because somebody did a Google search and some puppy went to what pulled a picture. From a domain because Google loads all those domains they would go across your firewall and you had to chase down why somebody was searching puppies on their work computer and it wasn't actually evil at all, right? And so you ended up with these thousands of alerts that didn't really do anything and it just caused a bad day for everybody, right? And so. Right around then, so now we're kind of in the 1516, 17 range, right? And soor came out and we're like, hey, we're gonna so we're gonna automate everything and then because we're gonna automate all of these things, it's just gonna magically work, right? Well, the problem with automation, and we're gonna talk about AI too, is not that automation or AI or any of those things are bad, it's that it automates whatever it is you're doing. Right? It automates you, it's an accelerator of you or your organization and so if you don't have the trade craft and methodology to facilitate what you're automating, it's gonna automate you off a cliff instead of automating you to not having anything happen in your environment. And so, What we put together and so as we started figuring out how to solve this problem, uh, we put together a reference architecture and I'm gonna, there's a lot here but we're gonna, we're gonna cut it up in bite size pieces and we're gonna talk to kind of how we think through what a SIM looks like what a next gen sim is, um, and kind of what the next iteration of sock operations are gonna look like and and and why it matters, right? Um, so first, instead of starting with your security tool, which is where most people start with, right, so I say I'm a detection engineer, the first question anybody asks me at any point in time is what SI, which tool, um, they don't talk about what's bad guy. They don't talk about what TTP or what assets I'm protecting. It's always what tool do you have? Well, let's throw that out. And let's start with what we're actually protecting. And so over here on the far left, you see this identity fabric, this, uh, dynamic context, right? Oh, sorry, um, because, so what we're looking at there and what we're really trying to understand is what are you writing? what what are the bad guys gonna come after and you can just assume they're gonna come after everything you have and of course there's priorities there and like what's actually important and what's not, but from that far left side you really need to start off with what exists here. Um, because If you don't know what's in your environment, then you can't protect what's in your environment, right? And then it's a bad day for everybody and so from your identifier breaking your, your dynamic context, you kind of go into the assets, right? So you got who's using your environment and what's going on there and then you kind of have what they're doing it on. So it's who and then what are they doing it on and so those are your end points it's your network it's your servers, it's your actual email server or your email service, however that works out for you, um, and, and once you have all of those things, the thing you'll start to notice is when there's a lot that you don't know about your network. And 2, it's really hard to ask really specific questions about what those assets look like or what those people are actually doing in your environment and so instead of starting with and saying hey give me all of your end points because that's a bit of a myopic question somebody will be like. Hey, these are all the laptops I have in an environment. Well, what about your servers or what about your firewalls? I think in the last 18 months, about 7 RCEs have been released for various firewalls that exist out there, and most people are not pulling the system telemetry from their firewalls, right? You're not ingesting that telemetry and so. We created this concept of, and I don't wanna say created we started talking about end points and assets in in this framework of like telemetry domains and so what that allows you to do is it allows you to separate your assets out into very bite sized pieces where you get into binary questions and question and answer with what with your IT operations. Organizations, right? So at the first one, let's say end points what communicates on the network? And if it communicates on the network, are we collecting telemetry from that which is being which is communicating on the network? And the answer is very much yes or no like do we have all of those things and if we don't have all of those things then what don't we have and why don't we have it? Um. I do we, are we not collecting this limitry from our firewalls because we don't, we can't put an agent on there? Well, maybe we need to talk about sys log or we need to talk about what that log for looks like there. Um, love the cloud. Are we collecting all of the end points or all of our virtual devices that exist in the cloud? Well, maybe we need to talk about how we build those devices. Well, what is our terraform? Are we going out and pulling agents to make sure all of the new stuff, even the stuff in development. Actually has some type of security uh security tooling on it so that we can collect what's going on there and and it goes down through the whole stack, right? So whether that's an application, whether it's an email like there are very clear questions that you should be asking for each of those domains and because those domains will then create a bucket for you to have a really clear conversation about. So for network ingress and egress points, are we watching all of the places that all of the doors to our network and sometimes there's. Point to point VPNs and the cloud is kind of made that question a little bit more complex than me just securing the edges of my boundary or my data center but at the end of the day I can still ask a really clear question of am I, am I monitoring all of the ways in and out of my network and if I'm not then which ones am I not monitoring and why am I not monitoring them, right? And so once you get to, once you get through that or how do you start to work through that because it's never actually done, as you start to figure out what you're monitoring and what you're not monitoring. You kind of get into this light purple box right? and it's the we call it a security data platform um all of the things inside of this are our security engine. I call it my little engine that can, um, because if you build it right you should be able to do and facilitate all of your security operations, right? So first step, all things need to go through some type of ETL ETL pha, right? Whether it's a platform, whether it's just a collection of Kafka devices, I, I, at this point if you're doing ETL and you're actually monitoring and managing your data flow and what goes where, then you're, you're. You're ahead you're winning, right? Give yourself a pat on the back. Let's go. But streaming that data, making sure that it's transformed and that it's loaded in places that it needs to be loaded into because the next step is that your data should actually probably be going into one of two places. It should either be going into your learning interface. We'll talk about what that is in a second or it should be going into your data lake. Now your a learning interface and we were actually talking about this earlier, is probably the closest thing we have to what I would call hot storage for your data. You want it to be fast because that's where your stock is going to be hanging out in. They're gonna be doing a lot of queries there. You want the responses to be fairly snappy. You don't want your analysts to go through and kick off a query, however they kick off that query, and wait 20 minutes for an answer in the middle of in the middle of an incident, right? You want that to be pretty quick. Part of the problem there is if you've just dumped everything into it, it's going to naturally slow everything down and doing fast searches, doing all of having all of that data stored hotly, uh, it's kind of expensive so you wanna keep the cost down there um because you know when you're doing security as a cost center you don't actually wanna be a pain in anybody's back you wanna, you wanna make people happy with the the outcomes that you're generating and then from the data lake perspective. I can't say this enough. One of the biggest differences as we look at what NextGen Sim actually means versus the previous generation of Sims is the existence of a data lake. Uh, we are rapidly approaching a place now where the amount of data that we're generating is so large, it's so big that if you don't have a data lake, you're probably not collecting all of the things that could be useful and just from a collection perspective you'd much rather have it not need it than need it and not have it. And, and so if you don't have a data like if you don't have a meaningful mechanism to store all of that data, then you're going to get yourself in a situation where you want to write an analytic, you wanna write a detection, but you can't because you're not collecting all of that data, um, and. Our learning interface is the place where we put our expensive data and our data lakes the place where we put our cheap data, so it should be a cost effective mechanism in which we can store all of that right now. Second part of the next generation sim and the second portion of importance here is your learning interface and your data like need to become best friends and not like best friends I call you once a month, like best friends like if I don't talk to you 3 or 4 times a day, my day is wrong. Like you gotta be really close here, right? Um, your learning mechanism should be able to query your data lake in a it doesn't have to be as fast as if it wasn't an incident, but it should they your your learning interface should be aware of what's going on in your data lake. Um, it should be able to reach in, it should be able to pull that out. It should be able to answer some questions about what data you're collecting or the current status of your environment as a whole. Once you get those relationships figured out and like nailed down, the place that you end up, you now have this security engine, the cybersecurity engine. That will facilitate a lot of your activities. Now it's not, do I need this data do I need this do I need this mechanism because it's already built now it's what am I going to do next, right? And so that's what we have on the security operations tool side of the house, right? I threw tools up there, but really it's anything that you could think of. Um, at the bottom we have APIs and direct connections. Uh, we got some data scientists that I work with and they love to just pull like pick apart my data. I want them to play in my data. I just don't want them to play in my data in my in my operational environment. And so that's where those API, those API connections come from. That's where those direct connections come from, um. Everybody loves to talk AI. They wanna talk models. They wanna talk, hey, is this, is this model good? Is this model bad? Um, that's down there that's gonna exist on top of your data lake. If you try to write an AI model and you don't have a data lake, your AI model is not gonna do very, uh, do a lot of good things for you. It's not gonna be helpful because it's gonna be trained on data that's not real. Um, it's gonna, and so there's gonna be hallucinations. You're gonna have to retweak everything and at that point in time your detection engineer is gonna show up and say, hey, I can just write a detection for this for a lot easier and a lot faster, and I promise it'll work better. Um, the other thing that happens is, and this is a new portion, I don't say new portion, but one of the things that I've noticed in as we start having these. More encompassing data platforms is that observability becomes this really valuable asset all of a sudden your security team starts to know more about your network than everybody else does, right? We may not know, we may not know why this API is making all these calls from a database, but we know that it is because we're writing detections they're supposed to be they're supposed to be upper and lower bounding like, hey, anything outside of what's normal is weird and we need to learn what's weird because we don't want anything to happen in our network, right? And so when we start getting into what this business intelligence looks like, this observability piece like that gets it exists on top of your data like and it gets really exciting because now we're asking real your security team starts asking really important questions like, hey, why does this backup service have permanent global domain admin rights to everything in the environment? It doesn't really need that and if it does need it for a second, then we should turn it off the rest of the time or better yet, actually just wrote a detection a couple of weeks ago where. It takes the stuff from your endpoint like new new account creations from your from your network and slams it against your identity management piece and says if there's a new account created that doesn't go through your identity system, well that's not good, so let's stop that um and so that's what starts happening whenever you get into that security tools piece, right? And then of course on the far right now we're in the pure operations, um, and so. And you know I called out our this inside of Deloitte we work inside of I work inside of defense and resilience because that's what we do um but we from an operational piece we leverage the whole you know engine that can to do these operations, right? So when we start having these conversations about can you write detections for us or can you do an IIR for us, one of our first. Questions is gonna be how is your data structured? How does this stuff stored uh my IR person's over there nodding her head because she agrees with me because we've been in this place like you, you, we wanna know, we wanna make sure that all that data is stored because whenever something bad happens you don't wanna be stuck asking who's on first or where this data is it's the wrong time to figure out your data strategy in the middle of an IR, right? Um, so all of this stuff we build at at the top you saw that I was cloud native we do that for availability we do it for resilience. Um, converged security is very specifically the relationship that we have with AWS where they give us a nice little engine and we build a bunch of things on top of it and we partner to deliver all of these services and things for our clients, um, and so that's what converge Security is for us, um. That's my time, everybody. Thank you so much. I will be around if there's any questions you guys have a great day.
