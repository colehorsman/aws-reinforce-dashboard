## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session (SEC327) presents a strategic approach to transforming security and compliance from operational burdens into innovation accelerators. Delivered by Jesse Skippy and Puneet from AWS Security Assurance Services LLC, the presentation introduces the concept of "compliance engineering" and demonstrates how to embed compliance by design within cloud environments using automation and engineering principles.

The session emphasizes the shift from traditional manual compliance approaches to automated, code-driven methodologies. AWS Security Assurance Services, a team of industry-certified auditors, works with customers on their side of the shared responsibility model to build scalable security and compliance programs. The speakers explain how to leverage AWS services to create a holistic control environment that includes directive controls (governance frameworks), preventative controls (Service Control Policies, IAM permissions), detective controls (Config rules, CloudTrail), and responsive controls (automated remediation through Systems Manager and Lambda functions).

A key theme throughout the presentation is the convergence of traditionally separate teams (security, compliance, and engineering) into unified "compliance engineering" or "security engineering" teams. This transformation is essential because in the cloud, everything is code - including compliance and security governance. The speakers demonstrate how this approach enables organizations to scale compliance across hundreds or thousands of applications while maintaining high velocity development cycles. They show practical examples of policy-as-code implementations and explain how 40-50% of technical controls in frameworks like NIST 800-53 can be automated through code.

All right, well thank you guys for joining. I'm super happy to see all of you here. Um, we're gonna talk about transforming security and compliance into your innovation catalyst, which I love. Um, I'm gonna do a quick introduction to the team that I lead that Puneet is a member of, and then we're gonna dive into the topic. So, um, sometimes some of you may not know that AWS has an audit entity within, uh, within AWS. So the team that I lead is called AWS Security Assurance Services. LLC, we are a team of industry certified auditors we work with customers on their side of the shared responsibility model, meaning we help customers build out scalable security compliance, um, programs so that they can have least resistance in adopting the cloud and cloud acceleration and so with that, um, we're gonna get started. Like I said, we help customers on their side on your side of the share responsibility, Mario, so we're not talking about compliance of the cloud, we're talking about compliance in the cloud and so compliance in the cloud starts with, of course, your compliance requirements. But be you well know this if you're in a regulated environment statutes, laws, standards, frameworks, things like PCI, ISO 27,0001, all of the alphabet soup, and also the over 130-ish. Data and privacy laws that are that are available globally depending on where you're conducting business today can lead to, as you well know, a lot of complexity. How do you balance those ever changing advancing regulatory statutes, keep your compliance in mind. And how does that translate into the control environment again, you have controls that are inherited by the platform and you also have your side of the responsibility to create that holistic control environment. The one great thing about AWS is you can leverage all of the controls that like the physical security, the things that AWS is doing for you, um. At that level You also have architecture and design, so how are the services connected? How does the control environment change and evolve as those services are being used? And then what I'm really excited to talk about and do more with our customers is the engineering and the operations aspect. So that's what we're really here to talk about because what we wanna do is enable our customers to truly leverage the power of AWS, the power of the cloud to secure the cloud, to show compliance in the cloud, and so that is what we want to share with you today. All right, I want to take over and smooth. OK. All right, thank you, Jesse for setting up the platform out here. So as we talked about, you know, Jesse mentioned, the engineering is the operations is the key. So what we want to basically enable our customers is embedding the compliance by design within your environment. So when you look at your particular environment, you have directive controls which are governed by your control frameworks, by our regulatory requirements defined by our secure configurations as you're defining those. Controls, you want to make sure you're enabling the preventative side from that standpoint, and there are capabilities which we enable from in the cloud side of the house where the customers enable is looking at looking at the service controls policies, looking at the IM permissions, making sure the resource control policies are enabled, building the guardrails within your pipeline from a preventative control at an organization level. Once the preventative controls are being built, then you want to. Sure that you're enabling the detective controls. What is being prevented, whether it's in an audit mode or a blocking mode, you want to make sure your preventative controls are working as effective as possible. So now you introduce the detective control concept. In the detective control concept, you want to make sure you're enabling the config rules, whether it's using the config rules which are defined within the AWS config or creating your own custom config rules, then enabling the other detective capability from clouds. cloud perspective and from an event bridge. Now once the detective controls are built, the next part of the journey is how do you make sure you are responding to the detections which are being done within the environment, how you are making sure that you're creating run books which are enabling you for remediation on the certain controls which needs to be remediated from an overall capability standpoint. So there are certain services which help from assistant manager. Which gives you an automation capability to run the books within the environment. Then it further you can create some custom lambda functions to create function as a service to enable the remediation or the response which is required from that standpoint. And when we talk about responsive controls, it's not just about remediation all the time. You want your security resources or security engineers or your risk engineers to respond to the alerts and take a required mitigation. they want to take so that enables you from a notification standpoint and at the end of the day as you are working with various lines of defense, you know, basically you look at the financial industry, you are part of the first line of defense or a second line of defense or a third line of defense. You want to produce the evidence which is showcasing how your whole life cycle of a compliance or a control is being built and showcase that what am I measuring against, right? That's where the evidence generation comes into play. Where we basically take into consideration all the preventative controls, detective controls, and responsive controls coming together and producing an outcome which can be further analyzed and consumed by your engineering team, by your, you know, second line of defense to showcase what the trust you have built within the cloud while you are either building a net new application or a workload or you're migrating an existing application or a workload within AWS enabling you the. With the design from a directive control to evidence generation, how that whole loop closes from an overall capability standpoint as we as we go into this, so one of the aspects which we want to talk about is how do we shift left, right? We talk about DevOps, we talk about, we talk about pipelines, we talk about engineering capabilities, right? So as you as you look at your engineering component, there are different preventative aspects which needs to be built, right? So you want to make sure. As you are following your DevOps model, you're building capabilities which are like meeting your compliance requirements within the within the plan phase. You divining policy is covered within your deployment, then you're enabling remediation automation if you're looking at the remediation component, then also doing a drift detection, making sure whatever services you have created, are they defined as per your standards or your directive controls and managing it effectively from a drift standpoint. And then other aspects which comes into the DevOps model is how do you keep on continuously testing those controls to make sure they are effective. They are operational, they are working as they're supposed to work, so enabling those from a controlled and a testing standpoint and then build the assurance to provide that outcome which can be consumable and can be trusted by the various entities within your organization from a security and compliance standpoint. Can I throw a surprise question at you. I'm thinking about our audience primarily security team members security how about uh compliance, compliance so we have some security and we have some compliance leaders do they do this on their own or how do they partner? So that's a great question, Jesse. I think so if you look at it, there is a there is a there is a convergence which is happening. Used to be a security team. There used to be an engineering team. There used to be a compliance team, so it's converging together and becoming a security and compliance engineering team. So most of the customers I've worked with and enabled them from a compliance standpoint, I'm seeing a concept called compliance engineering coming into play. We're basically taking the security controls which most of the organizations understand. They've been going through these audits and these various regulatory frameworks, but how do we make sure that they're showcasing the operational effectiveness by enabling automation within their environment really is a translation if you think about it from a non-technical control requirement to a very technical implementation and then coming back out in audit as a non-technical. And so I was kind of Setting you up for the question, but this is also something where partnership with your infrastructure and your application teams is critical because you can't do this alone, right? You have to develop an engineering mindset because in the cloud everything is code including compliance and security governance and so governance engineering is another term that I've I've heard so whether you call it compliance engineering, whether you call it security engineering. The engineering aspect in a cloud environment is real because everything is code everything is treated like a product and to reach high velocity acceleration in a regulated environment where you wanna go fast but you have to stay safe is the best partnership is with your application with your infrastructure team partnering with the lens of engineering as a security and a compliance leader. Yep. All right, so as we as we go through as we talk. About various controls like detective, preventive, directive, responsive, and then we also talked about shifting left within within the DevOps model. How do you scale these controls like because the power of cloud, the power of AWS is scalability, right, that's the core fundamentals. So how do we scale compliance at that, you know, component is basically introducing policy as code and doing compliance code at different levels, right? So basically, Providing the preventative components we call preventative controls which are like doing policies for building your service control policies, your resource control policies, applying guardrails within your pipeline from a policy standpoint, and then enabling that from an overall compliance by putting the managed controls within your infrastructure and automating that from the get-go itself rather than as an afterthought, which basically You know, always ends up chasing the compliance and becomes an afterthought rather than moving it towards the left, and that's why we basically enable those using different services like security hub, control tower, and things like that. Can I throw another surprise question at you? This is super fun. So in your experience, Penny, and I did forget to mention that within our team we've helped over 200 regulated customers migrate to the cloud in an accelerated way. And automating compliance. One question I want to ask you is you're talking about policy as code and compliance as code. How much of a traditional compliance framework, let's say for example like 853, what percentage of the technical controls can customers automate? So if you look at the 53, so I would say around 40 to 50% of the controls are technical controls because 20% are procedural. And then 30% are governance based controls within within the within the framework. So if you look at the 50% control, those 50% controls can be actually used as policycor or compliance is scored and can be moved towards the towards the reposit so just think about all of the manual effort it would take from from actually implementing these controls and so I wanted to set the stage for those that you're upliing. Are you ready to go slide here. OK. So giving an example, right, so we We from a policy cot we basically want to make sure we are enabling your environment with building the right capabilities by building the right components. So this is an example which shows where we actually developed an SCP for the environment to enable them from an overall service control policy within their environment and helping them use different components whether you're using terraform or cloud formation or any of those services. We want to bring that together and build that power of automation and engineering come together to enable not only the security team but also the infrastructure team and the application team because if you look at the application team and the infrastructure team, their job is to enable business, right? Their job is not to showcase compliance. So we are taking compliance and removing that as a blocker to make them, make them do the work they're supposed to do from a high velocity standpoint. And then another example which basically talks about the compliance code. We talked about preventative controls, but we also need to make sure you are validating what's been created to showcase are those controls working effectively because as an auditor right in my past life when I used to come and talk to the engineering folks and to the infrastructure folks, I know what you're talking about. I believe you built a control. But show me how you're detecting it. Show me the proof. Where where is it blocking? Show me where the actual magic is happening, right? So it's very critical to have a detective capability from an automation standpoint to showcase that outcome to the auditor because they want to look at it and say that yes, it's an end to end life cycle which you are managing from an engineering standpoint. All right, so when we talk about automation, we talked about compliance scored, we talked about policy scored, we talked about, uh, preventative controls, we talked about, you know, responsive controls. What does the journey look like from an automation standpoint? So the first step in the journey basically talks about secure code. When we talk about shift left, like you're creating your repositories, you're creating your services, you're creating your applications, your workloads, now you want to make sure that you're secure. The cord where the cord is being stored, whether it's terraform, whether it's cloud formation, securing that particular code, that's the foundation of the first step of the automation itself journey. The second step comes in is AWS services. Now you've written the code, you ditch in the terraform or in in the cloud formation, then it gets deployed within your AWS environment. So making sure your AWS services are configured in a. Particular compliant manner so that you can showcase the outcomes which are being produced from a from an overall life cycle. So that's where your second part of the journey comes into play. The third piece comes in the automation, right? How do I build the detective capabilities within the environment? Let's say if I'm rolling, if I'm building EC2 environment, if I'm building EKS clusters, if I'm building RDS S3s for a workload to operate, how do I make sure that they're working. from an automation standpoint, from an engineering standpoint, so building those controls from an automation, that's what the cloud or the AW brings to the flotation altogether. The next piece comes as custom controls. There are certain controls which are out of the box which you can consume on day one as you start rolling out these services, but if you want to make sure there are is a business context or a compliance context which is defined by your enterprise. How do you add that from a customization standpoint? The example which comes to my mind for this one, which is very, very common, is everybody, every organization has a requirement for encryption and data address. I've not seen an organization saying we don't want to encrypt anything, right? So when you use encryption address, you you're using AWS key management service right now within AWS key management service you get by default AWS managed keys. Right, but your standard says I want to use a customer managed keys now to make sure your customer managed keys are being used, are being rotated, are being, you know, administered well, that's where the custom controls come into play because that's the standardization, that's the contextualization which comes into play from a custom control standpoint. And then the last piece of the journey is evidence generation talking about bringing it to the full life cycle of saying. I built all these controls from the code itself to the end of the custom control. How do I bring that into the closed loop from an evidence generation so that I can showcase it to the auditors, showcase it to the folks to get the approval on that front? Yeah, I love this part because we don't want to be doing screenshots or you know no shoulder surfing, right? If you think about the environment and the cloud and everything is code. Evidence generation should be no different, right? You should be able to evidence without bothering the the development teams and and getting that data. All right, over to you. All right. Old way versus new way. All right, I'm just gonna open up the screen here so the the old way, which may be the current way, um, fix and patch production, doing security reviews, getting committee approval, uh, compliance checks, manual code reviews, architecture reviews. Now it's not that you're gonna get away completely from doing some of these functions, but there's definitely a lot of changes that the conversation changes along the way. Uh, you wanna get to the scalable environment where you are redeploying using pipeline controls, right? Like there's nothing better than the pipeline stopping when the policy doesn't meet your requirements, right? You're, you're preventing that code from being published to production in a different way than you had before, right? That's the power of policy is code, um, security in and of the. Pipeline like I just said, uh, self-service continuous governance like the, the way we scale at AWS and the way we focus our customers towards is how do you take something and and how do you create the ability to repeat it so whether you have 9 applications or 900, being able to repeat that process is super important. And then automated evidence collection like we talked about. And we are ending with just a minute to spare. Um, I wanna thank all of you for listening in. Um, again, my name is Jessie Skippy.
