Welcome everyone. So let's start. I'm gonna start with a quick question. How many of your organizations have tried to upskill developers or other roles in security? Raise your hands or how many of you have tried to upskill in security but don't know how or don't know where to start? Raise your hands. Good. Uh, well, you're in the right place, or if you're just curious person having to land here, you're also in the right place. Today I'm gonna be introducing the newly launched security champion learning plan in um AWS a skill builder. Uh, as you, as many of you know, security is a must and it should be everybody's responsibility. This is a 200 level talk where I'm gonna be talking about how you can equip yourself and your workforce through security training. My name is Alejandra Lopez. I'm a senior go to market manager at AWS. I've been working at AWS for the past 5 years, and I'm very excited to be here today. Let's go over the agenda. Here is what we will cover today. We will take a look at the business impact and the skills gap, the cloud security, the skills gap. This will help us understand why it's important and why are we doing this learning plan in IAWS to help you address the business impact and the skills challenge. Then we will dive deep into the learning path, what it includes some of the courses that includes, and lastly, how you can take immediate action. So let's dive in. Did you know that most breaches are due to human error and they cost on average $4.45 million. According to a psychology report, 9 in 10 data breaches are due to employees' mistakes, and these are based due to poor security awareness, weak leadership commitment, or inadequate training. As you know, these, uh, these bridges, they, they impact health industry, finance industry, but not only these industries are impacted by it, technology companies are also very impacted. This shows how many organizations don't fail on technology but also on culture. Data breaches cost real money as you can see here and it's not just, it's not just like how these industries are wrongly impacted by it, but how the organizations can do better. This is one of the reasons that it is very important to ensure our workforce is ready for everybody champion security. There is disparity between perceived security preparedness and readiness in organizations. According to drop, organizations are facing a critical challenge in cloud security, marked by a dramatic 56% increase in cloud security gaps since 2021 and also leaving 4.15 million security positions unfulfilled. How many of you have encountered challenges trying to fill, um trying to fill security roles raise your hands, OK? I see some hands raised. Well, let me tell you, you are not alone. This quote that you see here sums up what a lot of our customers are telling us they want to to have a security training program. There is an interest there to upskill their workforce, but they just don't know where to start. And also a lot of the, a lot of times, uh, the capacity and also curriculum design are most of the times major blockers. Security is more than tools it's a mindset and should be everybody's responsibility across the organization. Now imagine if you could equip your team to advocate for security and to become security champions without having to pull security engineers away from projects or even better without having to start a curriculum from scratch. Training a team on security champions is a more cost effective approach than relying solidly on a small security team to train security um and educate security across the entire organization. Now let's go over the definition of who is a security champion. These individuals are professionals trained in technical skills and also in leadership capabilities. They are, they serve as advocates in companies advocating for the technical skills and also um executive leadership. They bring these teams together. These are um in today's distributed and fast-paced cloud environments having dedicated security champions across different teams is no longer optional, but it's also essential to for maintaining a robust posture in cloud security. This distributed ownership uh comes with a lot of benefits. For instance, faster development cycles as teams can address security concerns proactively also um reduce incidents because they can detect them earlier and improve collaboration between security and development teams. Most important, it creates a security first culture where every team across the organization, they understand the importance of protecting the organization's assets and data. At AWS we have created a new learning path called AWS Security Champion Learning Knowledge Path. This is, um, this is a, this is on a skill builder that's our official online center. And um it's an 18 course path curriculum that takes approximately 25 hours to complete. This is a structured curriculum, it's self-paced and it combines technical and leadership training to meet teams where you are. Who is this for? This plan is built for executives, cloud practitioners, development teams, cloud security professionals because security, as you know, is a team sport. What is included in this learning plan? Well, as I, as I, as I said earlier, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. You don't need to start from scratch. This implant this plan includes created content from AWS security foundational courses to more advanced courses such as security, automation, container security. And it also allows learners for a hands-on experience. We have similar. I don't know if uh you have already tried um some uh similar learning those computers behind here, but similar learning is a course that is powered by generative AI providing learners real world case scenarios. In this case, um, the learner will be able to experiment with a real world case scenario, propose a solution, and even build it on AWS console. This is a great opportunity for learners to be to get hands on and practice their skills learned. Upon completing this program, there is an assessment that takes approximately 1 hour and a half to complete. Learners will have to pass with a score of 18% or better, and then they will obtain the newly launched Security champion digital badge. This is a great way to verify their expertise and also for companies to to show that they are committed to security excellence. This badge is not just a sticker. It's also a, is a proof of knowledge in AWS cloud security best practices. So now this is a recap. What can you do? You can drive security practices across the organization. Continue equipping your workforce with the right tools and learning paths as the one that I just went over. This is a great opportunity for you to um equip builders to become security champions and as um according to Gardner report champions uh once they feel value once they feel supported and connected, they stay engaged and that's will build a long lasting culture of security. And how you can do that. You can also create monthly touch points where um security champions can come together, share their experiences, or even internal group chats where they can share their success stories, lessons learned, tips. That's a way, uh, that's a great way to keep them connected and engaged. This is how you can take immediate action by scanning this QR code that you see here. You just, you can use book bookmark it or you can go to AWS skill builder and also um enroll in the security knowledge. Learning path, uh, this it it provides flexible options in terms of pricing for individual learners. It's 29 per month and 14 subscriptions is $449 per year with volume pricing available. Once learners enroll in and subscribe to SkillBuilder, they don't only get access to this plan, but they get access to a lot of learning plans. They have access to more than 600 on-demand courses, digital classes also they get access to. AWS certification official practice assent and gamify experience and more than 200 labs here you can see the code, uh, the QR code for a skill builder and the next one is for the different AWS certifications that we offer. This is it for today. Thank you so much for your time. If you have any questions or you need more details on how to subscribe, please let me know. I'll be here answering any questions. Thank you.
