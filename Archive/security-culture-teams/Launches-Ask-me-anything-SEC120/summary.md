## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session (SEC120) is an interactive Ask Me Anything format discussing the major security service launches announced during the conference keynote. The session primarily focuses on AWS Security Hub's significant preview release featuring enhanced exposure-based findings that correlate multiple security signals into contextualized threat assessments. The discussion covers how the new Security Hub addresses common CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) challenges like excessive false positives and noisy alerts by providing intelligent correlation and network path analysis.

Key topics include the introduction of AWS Shield Network Director for network policy visibility, integration of automated reasoning for vulnerability exposure assessment, and improved remediation workflows with ticketing system integration. The session also touches on broader AWS security strategy including shifting security left in the development lifecycle, code scanning capabilities through Inspector, and the evolution from attribute-based access control (ABAC) to account-based segmentation strategies. AWS engineers emphasize that these launches aim to simplify security operations by providing better context and reducing alert fatigue through intelligent aggregation.

## Key Points
- New AWS Security Hub preview introduces exposure-based findings that correlate multiple security signals for better context
- Addresses CSPM noise problems by intelligently analyzing whether vulnerabilities are actually exploitable based on network reachability
- AWS Shield Network Director provides comprehensive visibility into network policies and potential misconfigurations
- Automated reasoning determines actual internet accessibility rather than just configuration-based assessments
- Integration with ticketing systems and incident response runbooks for streamlined remediation workflows
- Code scanning through Inspector enables shift-left security from development through production

Hey team Mars, how's it going? All right, so this is an Ask Me Anything session for all the key launches. So feel free to ask us any questions. There's a mic there for the audience. Uh, there was a lot of key launches that were announced in the keynote. You'll go first. I didn't have a question about one of the, the key launches. I, I wasn't aware that that's, it had to be a question about that. So my question was about, um, when you're first starting in your AWS journey and you have your, I guess. My question was about the, uh, when you're first starting about your AWS journey, um, and you have your presence and everyone is jumping on board. Um, I was looking for guidance on creating some kind of like an e form or something for those requests to, um, better facilitate the, uh, the, I guess what we to give them what they want access to rather than just like a team's message or email or something that they can fill out and then that directly um correlates to what they end up with in the AWS environment. But again I didn't know it needed to be about the, the launch. I apologize. All good. uh, and I'll answer that one. So it, it probably comes down to like whatever you like internal ticketing and processes are, right? There's also gonna be a number of different things about like standard permissions that you might give like based on roles or based on like different application types and things like that. So it's, it's really more around building the processes of like. Uh, you know, maybe it's a ticketing system to get new access. Maybe it's, you know that there's gonna be a types of roles and types of applications and you build up your standard permissioning for those, um, you know, how are you gonna do access is through a third party identity, uh, provider? Is it through like identity center, right? You there's gonna be a number of things there so you kinda, it'll once it gets standardized, you probably won't have as many like ad hoc requests where you're like the intake form is the. You know, the most challenging thing that you have, uh, I'd work on getting like access patterns down and like some sort of uh trends identified first and then, uh, that will kind of help, uh, the journey of where you would go there I think. Yeah, yeah. All right, uh, any other questions related to, yeah. Hi, um, I have a question about, uh, some of the network intelligence. So as part of the presentation, at least the way I interpreted it was going after CSPMs, right? I know you guys didn't use those words, my words, don't have to agree. Um, specifically around networking, so, uh, you know, I've evaluated various tools like all the big ones, right? And what I find when they do network reporting is there's a lot of noise, for example. Securities group is 0000, so it's, you know, critical, don't do this, but it's in a private subnet. So yes it's sloppy but it's not critical. So my question to you guys is how mature is your networking, uh, analysis because as a security architect, right, I get 700, maybe not 700, 200 criticals of those 200, only 50 are legitimate criticals, a lot of slop, but they're not critical. So I'd like to see how secure uh how mature the tool is. Yeah, so I'll I'll take an attempt, uh, at this, and then I'll let Marshall elaborate. So first of all, I think in the, in the keynote session you must have heard about, uh, a service called Blackfoot. It's not necessarily a service, it's something that we use internally to translate all the IP addresses that are coming in and then translating them internally into AWS's private network. Uh, that same service is what's used to also surface, uh, some of the correlated IP addresses and the domain names in all of our internal security services. Uh, one of the other key features that was, uh, announced today is the preview of AWS Shield network director. Uh, even though I think the name is Shield, but the idea is that we want to provide customers full visibility into where the network policies are, how are they configured, and then what could be the potential misconfigurations around those network policies leading to either exposures or threats. The the other correlated element which is where some of these findings will get aggregated are in a security hub. So going back to your question of like you know like how are these IP addresses and findings getting prioritized so if you see like a 0.0.0, how do we make sure that it's not a false uh positive, right? Yeah, noise, yeah, what you wanna. Yeah, yeah, I can, I can take it from there. So essentially think about think about like that same scenario. So now with the security hub and what was launched today, essentially it'll take a number of different things into account. So like Inspector does a couple things from like a vulnerability assessment, but it also has like network reachability so it uses automated reasoning to determine like for that that security group that's 0.0. Is there an actual route from the Internet to this instance and so then it can say like hey look you've got 0.0. It is reachable from the Internet. It does have let's say a guard duty finding. It's also connected to an S3 bucket that has sensitive data like that would be an actual critical versus like. Hey, this one has a remote code execution vulnerability that's a 9 CBSS score. But it's actually not reachable from the internet, so like it's and uh there's not really any other control issues with this machine so it's really more like a medium level severity so that we're essentially making those uh exposure based findings but that will that it's gonna give that context and correlation of understanding the different inputs instead of just hey this is uh you know taking something at face value per se so the exact problem that you're. You know, bringing up is what we're addressing in in Security hub, uh, uh, with this launch. Right. Um, yeah, I, I, I'm, I would love to hear more about this, like how the security hub now, uh, actually correlates this data because as uh as you already mentioned, like there is so many tools that can report the security hub, let's say confi rule looking for these, you know. 0.0.0 uh security group which is producing little to no value basically in most cases and then you have like the network analyzer so sorry may I may be missing names uh we have the um uh the sorry um. Inspector that you mentioned which is also using underneath, I think the network path analyzer and now you're having also some new launches like this network something uh that has been launched today and you get all of these findings in the one place called Security Hub. Are you making with this new release any kind of. Um Post-processing of those findings to compile them somehow or this is like, hey, this is 5 findings regarding the same instance with different severities because they're reported by different tools. Yeah, so it is exactly what you were saying that it, it is doing that post processing of like we've taken these different signals in and we essentially call them different like traits and then uh bringing that together and like adding the context to it like is it publicly accessible what vulnerabilities are associated with it? what configuration issues are associated with these resources does it have access to things like sensitive data like it, it brings all of that together and then essentially creates uh a new exposure finding. Um, so it's not like it in, and then in that exposure finding you'd have like the different traits underneath it which are all the like individual findings that you would have had in the past and had to like correlate together it's bringing it together and giving you this exposure finding that's the severity is based on the correlation and the context that it's able to provide. Yeah, so, so the new user experience in security hub will be now where originally it was acting as a cloud security posture management tool. And then aggregating the findings from not just configurations or misconfigurations but also our partner tools, the new experience now includes things like not only showing you that there are individual findings which might be at times stateless because Guard duty found a threat. Many days ago on an instance there was a finding and then inspector found a vulnerability, there was a finding, and then there was a misconfiguration, but now there will be correlations with exposures. So imagine there's an EC2 instance it was having an open vulnerability. Because of that vulnerability there was an RDP brute force that got exposed and that that RDP brute force happened because there was an open port or an SCP. So in the exposure finding you'll be able to see now what are the correlated findings that led to that exposure and then it'll also show you the network path that the threat actor or that bad malicious activity took. And and that attack path will be seen like in a graph format so you'll be able to see like in a visual pattern what are the primary resources that are impacted and then also what are the secondary resources that potentially that you could like now go in and for supply chain security make sure that that threat's not only manifesting in the primary resource but also some of the attached resources. The other thing that's important is that early. Customers had to go in and look at IM entity roles or AWS resource names and then filter those things within Security hub or wherever they were aggregating the findings now you'll be able to easily see those correlations within the Security Hub console without having to go in and jump around. So it's all on the team of like simplifying security by bringing in this aggregated correlation and context in one place. I'm sorry, I'm probably gonna be end up being a pain. All right, so one small follow up and then completely different topic. When you talk about network, you know, layering the network information right? and saying it's publicly accessible, I think. As a person, if someone tells me an EC2 is publicly accessible, to me cognitively I think, well, it's in a public subnet and you can directly get to it, but a lot of tools I don't know about necessarily here, but I can tell you other tools will say it's publicly accessible, which is technically true. If you go through an ALB through a public subnet da da da da da and 6 layers down, it can get down to the EC2. So technically it is publicly accessible but not what I as a person would characterize as public. it's just a detail you can it's just a comment. So again my experience which again may not be reflected here, is that a lot it'll say a lot of things are publicly accessible badass security group but. Yeah, you have to go through 6 things and it's not, you know, a lot of that context is lost. wait, completely different topic, remediation. Uh, I would like to know. Uh, I'd like for you to expand upon like some, you know, some primary use cases around remediation that you guys are focusing on and, uh, as a follow on to that, if you remediate it. Uh, what are your thoughts on creating drift, right? So let's say I'm a slop, well, I am a sloppy developer, right? So I wrote some crappy terraform code, right, that, you know, open, you know, does some ridiculous thing, and then now you remediate me because I'm a dummy, right? Can you talk me through like some of the typical remediation use cases that you guys are looking at and your thoughts on drift. Yeah, uh, I'm a sloppy developer too, uh, but no, no, no, to your, to your point though, um, one of the things that we introduced in the new launch of Security Hub is, uh, just integration with ticketing systems because of a lot of the feedback that we get is about, well, if I do remediate something I'm gonna have drift or the security team doesn't have the context into what they. Can remediate how they can remediate it so we're doing a number of different things in that area and one of the other launches that we had was code scanning uh through Inspector. So if you kind of think of the the journey of vulnerabilities and what we're monitoring in AWS now you have like you know cu developer that can see security issues like in an ID while you're developing you've got code security that's managed by like a central security team. And then Inspector also has integrations with like uh CIC pipelines that can you know block a pipeline from running if you know, based on different vulnerabilities uh and then all the way through knowing if images get deployed and what container or where they're running and things like that. So when it comes to the remediation aspect, we're trying to do a more integrated approach of like all the way from. All the way from the the developer who types in the code and um monitoring along the way that way you know where it needs to be fixed versus introducing remediation capabilities that create a mess in an environment. I think if you look at the journey like you said from a software development standpoint, it starts by shifting left. So what we are doing is, uh, using inspector and code scanning. It is, it is, it is both. So Security hub enables you to run automated run books, which could be a combination of automation rules that you've created. So if you have an incident response runbook you can today easily import that runbook into Security Hub. And then execute that now with the new feature, what you'll be able to do is create configuration rules to say hey this finding type or this exposure type is highly critical and I need to go run a run book which is associated with that or you could say if a resource matches a finding where it's network reachable, what is the preventative controls or policies that you would want to take so that is what a typical incident response action would be. But if you go back to where it actually originated, which is the developer life cycle, so we're what we're doing is using generative AI and using automation in the developer life cycle, also helping when developers are writing code or calling vulnerable APIs or packages. Letting them know that there is a vulnerability in this package and what should be the remediation steps taken by the developer to fix that as well. So it's both like where you can do active IR as a security operations team and you can build that into the development life cycle as well. Co Anybody else? Any questions? Any other questions related to the launches in the keynote? Or any other general questions. Is there any stand where we can have a look at these new features of security hub? I'm like mostly interested in this, as the old security hub has a couple of the deficiencies that I was interested to look, how they have been solved in the new release. I didn't, I didn't hear it exactly. Sorry, sorry, uh, yeah, yeah, the, the, the question was mainly, uh, about the, is there any stand where I can learn more in depth regarding new security hub related launches? Yeah, absolutely. So we're gonna have certainly there's multiple blog posts coming out about not only like how you you get started with the new security hub experience but also deep diving into like some of the exposure findings and uh one of the colleagues on my team wrote that so you'll be able to see plenty of that. A couple of things to note is it's also in public preview and you can get started uh kind of free of charge so definitely go in there, test it out, uh. And uh that's and read those blogs. Yeah, so there'll be two sessions that I know of like we'll dive deeper into some of this stuff with actually demos. Uh there's one at 4:30 today which will talk about, uh, it's TDR 301, uh, which talks about all the key innovations in our detection and response portfolio that'll cover AWS Security hub preview. And like Marshall said, uh, you know, there'll be blog posts coming out and then we also will do uh activation days which is customer facing, uh, sessions that we do where you can sign up and just watch how the service works. It's actually run by the community of our technical field uh experts who will showcase uh how some of these services work and then because it's preview you can easily go in and just sign up for the new security hub and then try it out yourself as well. Yep, there's also a session tomorrow at 3 for implementing security best practices where we're gonna give a demo in it, uh, a demo of it as well. Yeah You mean Sorry, um, by the way, full disclosure, I work for Stacklet, which is based off cloud custodian. Uh, I don't know if you're familiar with Cloud custodian. So, um, I work for Stacklit, uh, which is, is the engine is cloud custodian. Just full disclosure, just just to be straight up. OK, um. Several years ago there was a push towards AAC attributes based access control, right? So in the resource policy you'd have dollar project name or something, right, some variable and uh I don't hear that anymore so I'm wondering is AWS's position and you may not know this is definitely out of left field. Is the position to move away from ABA or is it still a supported kind of sort of considered good practice? Cause I don't hear about it anymore. Yeah, so what we did in that space, uh, one thing is AEC could get complicated, right? So I am, yeah, uh, but, uh, when we have things like we've expanded the amount of accounts that you could use and, and some of the different controls that we've introduced through AWS organizations, it made it made it easier to split these up by accounts. The AAC use case was more of, so you've got multiple people in a single account that don't, you don't want them accessing. Each other's resources so you had to uh uh limit that based on the policy versus splitting up workloads based on accounts so then you didn't have to do the splitting of those policies or the permissions to that single account and it made that. Little more simple, but there are certainly still use cases and we've added other tags and things that have made AAC easier over the years, um, but, but yeah, so there's still use cases if you had multiple roles or like people personas in a single account then you know it's still definitely applicable and, and, uh, but yeah, it made it a little easier with like accounts uh segmentation. All right, I think we're out of time, uh, but thanks a lot for joining. If you have any questions, please follow up. Uh, there'll also be like other chalk talks and sessions happening that'll cover all these key launches. Thank you. Thank you.
