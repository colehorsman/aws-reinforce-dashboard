## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session (SEC320) is an expert Q&A session with Kevin Shanley (Principal Solutions Architect and Identity Specialist) and Karen Haberkorn (Product Leader in AWS Identity) following the conference keynote. The session focuses on identity and access management innovations announced during the keynote, with particular emphasis on the new AWS Access Analyzer internal access analysis feature and broader security announcements.

The discussion covers AWS's milestone achievement of 100% MFA enforcement for root credentials across all AWS accounts, a journey that began in fall 2023 with gradual implementation. The speakers highlight the significance of central root access management features that allow organizations to remove root credentials from member accounts entirely, reducing attack surface while improving security. The session also touches on integration improvements between perimeter services like API Gateway, WAF, and Shield, along with practical guidance on implementing least privilege access patterns using Access Analyzer at the organization level.

## Key Points
- AWS achieved 100% MFA enforcement for root credentials across all accounts, completing a journey started in fall 2023
- New Access Analyzer internal access analysis feature focuses on "crown jewel" resources like S3 and DynamoDB within organizations
- Central root access management enables removal of root credentials from member accounts, reducing attack surface significantly
- Access Analyzer operates at organization level, analyzing access patterns across hundreds of accounts from delegated administrator accounts
- Policy Validator tool includes 100+ built-in checks against AWS IAM best practices with CICD pipeline integration
- Amazon Verified Permissions dropped pricing by 97% (from $150 to $5 per million requests) with new Node.js framework support
- Seven new compliance framework mappings added to AWS Control Catalog for easier compliance achievement
- Access Analyzer pricing is per-resource, encouraging focus on high-value assets rather than comprehensive coverage

## Technical Details
- **Access Analyzer Internal Analysis**: Daily updates with notification integration via EventBridge for immediate access change alerts
- **Organization Scope**: Operates from management account or delegated administrator to analyze access across all member accounts
- **Resource Focus**: Targets S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and relational databases as priority "crown jewel" assets
- **MFA Implementation**: Gradual enforcement across account tranches with central management features for large organizations
- **Policy Validation**: 100+ security and hygiene checks integrated into CICD pipelines with severity-based alerting
- **Cost Optimization Strategy**: Recommend OU-based approach focusing on production environments while leaving dev/sandbox open
- **Perimeter Integration**: Unified CloudFront console experience for configuring WAF, Shield, and API Gateway together
- **Network Security Director**: Automated risk assessment across network topology with opinionated rule set recommendations
- **Session Reference**: IAM 307 session scheduled for deep dive on Access Analyzer features with live demonstrations
- **Framework Integration**: Node.js Express middleware for Amazon Verified Permissions removes authorization code from applications
- **Compliance Automation**: Seven new framework mappings enable automated compliance checking across multiple regulatory standards
- **Non-Transitive Analysis**: Access Analyzer provides direct access visibility; partner tools and Amazon Detective handle role chaining analysis

## Full Transcript

Good afternoon everyone. My name's Kevin Shanley. I'm a, a principal solutions architect and identity specialist, uh, within AWS, and I'm here with Karen Haberkorn. Hi, I'm Karen Haberkorn. I'm a product manager or product leader in the AWS identity space, so we're both identity people. Um, I've been at Amazon for more than 20 years, so if you don't ask questions about the keyut, I will bore you with my stories about the olden days. So, uh, this would be a good time to get ready to rev up your questions. Awesome. All right. Anybody have a question? I am handing out stickers if that is a draw for you to ask a question, so no, no stickers. So rather silly quick question. What? So you in the keynote there was announcement of almost every service had something new. Is there sort of a summarized version of that somewhere? Is there a summary of thats? Uh, I don't actually know. I'm sure we will publish a summary. Jade, are you sure, are you aware of that? You know the answer to this right, awesome. So myself and some of my colleagues for the sticker you didn't want on repost, well, actually AWS repost is a knowledge management platform. My colleagues and I usually write up an exhaustive list as well as some of our evangelists like Jeff Barr and that will typically publish a blog of the actual announcements. But at the conclusion of uh the conference there's also when you go back to the site there's usually a long long list of all of the announcements. But beyond the list I'd kinda like to riff on your question a little bit although I'm gonna direct it to Kevin, which was the announcement out of that list that you were most excited about? Well, first off, I love that it all starts with identity and access management. I got to be first. How great is that? It's, it's where we live, um, uh, but in terms of the actual announcements, the new Access Analyzer, uh, internal analysis feature that is super important. And Access Analyzer is actually one of the fastest growing innovative services and certainly within, within, uh, identity overall. Uh, it's really exciting the way that the whole thing's actually gone. Um, and we often talk about access analyzer in terms of, it's a journey to least privilege. It's not a destination, you're always gonna be iterating and, and trying to get there, but we also like to say that. You don't do least privilege for least privileged sake, it's all about risk. And so we want to be able to cover out, you know, what are, what are our core assets, what are those important things we need to actually make sure that we're, we're safeguarding. And that's really what this internal access analyzer announcement's all about. So going after S3 and Dynamo database, relational databases, and giving you that sort of inside or or inside account uh analysis feature. Yeah, we don't, we don't imagine that you would use the internal access analyzer on every resource you have. Um, we imagine that you would use it for your crown jewels for that, you know, that that data which is critically important to your business where if if you had the access wrong to that it would make all the difference and the the internal access analyzer updates every day and can send you notifications so you could if you if you accidentally granted access to one extra person who probably shouldn't have it, you'll find out you'll find out that day and be able to remediate it quickly. Yeah, you just hook it up to a t bridge, sends you a notification and you can fix it posthaste. How about you, Karen? What was your favorite? Oh sorry. Yeah, I was just gonna ask if there are any sessions that are gonna be added on the new features on Access Analyzer. There is a session that's gonna be added to the catalog. I actually checked right before this and I didn't see it yet, but, uh, I, I can tell you that it's gonna be I am 307 um uh if you want, I don't, I, I don't know how how long it takes for the catalog to update. Um, but that session will go deep into that feature and, uh, with a demo which is a really cool thing to see, by the way, so, uh, um, but we can, I can find out exactly what time it is, but it should be added to the catalog soon if it's not there already. Awesome. Questions, questions, anyone have a question. So one of the features that I looked at and was pretty interesting was API gateway and um uh VAF integration, I think, uh or simplifying that aspect of it. Uh, am I right or? There there were a couple of announcements related to perimeter services um uh I can talk at a very high level about them, but we're identity people so pretty soon we're gonna refer you refer you to the booth. One of the features that that Amy talked about, which I, I, I think is particularly interesting because I happen to focus a little bit in my role on user experience is they've brought together a bunch of the services you need to configure. At the perimeter into a cloud front so that instead of having to jump around in all the different consoles you can actually follow a work a work through in one place and a lot of you may not use the console you may use infrastructure as code to automate things but there is no better way that I know of to learn how to use AWS services together and the fact that they've brought all these, you know, all this configuration into one place I I. Check it out. I think it's really delightful how it sort of guides you through the experience, um, but they also talked about from a capability standpoint how with WAF and also at with Shield we're starting to make more opinionated recommendations about what you need to do with your network, uh, where, you know, the, the network security director sort of looks across your network topology. And identifies the riskiest aspects of your configuration and then makes recommendations about rule sets you should add at the either the shield layer if it's at the or or at the WAF layer um so that you can actually correct the issues that might be most risky to your network. If I say anything else about it, I'm gonna go beyond my level of expertise. So if you have questions about those rule sets, I will, I will find you the right spot in the booth and then and then the perimeter protection people to talk to. Anyone else have questions? All right, there's some back there. Yeah. Whoa, that's really hard to hear. I'm sorry. All right, yeah, there we go. Oh, that's way better. I don't like to hear my own voice. Um, so this might be a dumb question, but uh you know the rule that no questions are dumb, right? To me, it might be dumb. Um, so, uh, of course with the IMX access analyzer, that's something that's really interesting to me as another IM guy. So, uh, how is it, how does it, I know, I understand how it works on an account level, but from an organization standpoint when you're working with hundreds of accounts. Uh, how well does that work or is there a different way that that uh that analysis works to provide feedback to, uh, you know, that, that main account that is monitoring that? Sure, the, the way I would think about it is before today, uh, Access Analyzer had an external access findings capability, so it basically let you figure out if this is my organization who can get into this resource from the outside. What changed today is we now have an internal access analyzer. You can figure it either from your organization management account or better practice from the delegated administrator account that you specify to operate Access Analyzer, and you can designate any resource and anywhere any member account in your org so like if you're if you know that the pro the pro you with this particular workload account, that's the one with the S3 bucket you care about, you can designate that resource and it will look across all of the accounts in your organization. To see who what roles and what IM users have access to that resource, so it operates at that organization level looking across every account in your org, and you have the control as the administrator to both identify the resource and then to see all the all the paths from within your org to that resource. Does that make sense? And I think it's also important to whenever we're talking about access analyzer, it often comes up how do I manage costs, how do we keep this as a cost efficient operation, um, so overall we recommend like an OU strategy of, you know, if you're gonna have a sandbox or dev OU, a test or QA and production. You of course want to focus your access analyzer in production, but also to constrain the access and constrain it inside your test environment. Usually dev sandbox, you want to leave it wide open, don't slow down your developers, make sure they can do what they need to do as you're promoting through environments, that's where you can really start to, you know, uh, turn the screws and and tighten up your controls overall. Um, you don't necessarily want, as I said, uh, oops. Don't walk too far forward. Don't wanna do least privilege for, for least privileged sake, um, and so you do want to constrain these, these components on, you know, what is, you wanna control the risk, what is high value around this stuff, um. And so you don't need to run it every day and you know maybe you're gonna run a report about unused access, but you don't need to necessarily run it every day, right? you just kind of control how those things are done so that you can best optimize, uh, you know, all the findings you're getting from all of this and and optimized cost on top of it. Just to add to what Kevin said, the internal access analyzer is priced per resource, which is just telling you pick the resources that you really care about the access to. As Kevin said, if this is a low value resource, it's it's probably not worth your valuable, uh, valuable dollars to spend, you know, to, to really understand all those paths as deeply or just the time to investigate alerts, you know, you're looking for a needle in a haystack. You don't want more hay, so very cool. Alright, I think there's a question right there. All right, um, you mentioned earlier about how we can point access analyzer things, they can analyze it, it can map it out, and it can make recommendations for us, right? Um, and I, the goal is we, we take those recommendations, we make those rule changes and policy changes and things, and it becomes part of our IAC stack, right? Um, are there more, uh, is there a way to go about that in reverse? Like, does AWS maintain like a, like repositories of known best practices that we should start from and then run Access Analyzer after that? If I understand your question correctly, I think the answer is yes. So I think your question is, is there a way for me to check some of my configuration or my policies against known AWS best practices? Right, like I'm familiar with things like compliance packs, right, where we get config rules via control tower and things like that. I'm talking about, but, but access analyzer would do things that are more deeper level like down at the service level, right? Like this, this access shouldn't exist to this thing, right? And you provide a recommendation, go fix this thing. Are there known repositories of things that you should start from to decrease the findings from your initial scans, I guess. Yeah, Kevin may have things to add, but I, I think there are two, I have two suggestions. The first is we do have a tool that's called Policy validation or the policy validator which has more than 100. I don't know the latest count of built in policy checks that are checking your IM policies against best practices, and it generates uh alerts based on severity. So a security warning is like get on it and. You can integrate it into your CICD pipeline such that if it found a security alert against your IM policy you could block you you you could just abort your deployment at that point and then it has less serious things that are a little bit more about hygiene like a warning when there's a duplicate statement for example which you could just clean up but it doesn't necessarily affect the result um you can you can integrate the policy validation you can run it by. The way we run it for you in the console on any IM policy you're editing and then you can run it yourself in your CICD pipeline to to sort of check your policy against those best practices checks for Access Analyzer, uh, there is a known best way to integrate it with CICD. I'm pretty sure there's even a session today where someone walks through how they integrate Access Analyzer their checks, but it's less about to my best of my knowledge, it's less about their being pre. Set checks as much as making sure you're getting that data in your pipeline and making decisions about it, but I, I, I'd recommend checking out the session to to see if it has more deep, deeper suggestions for you. Yeah, it's, it's unfortunately a bit difficult for us to provide heavily detailed prescriptive guidance around that because, you know, are you segregating accounts based on workloads or environments or you know they're just all sorts of different ways that customers uh set this stuff up and if you need to start doing cross account access for you know your data stores or whatnot, uh. The policies are all gonna be different and and so it just becomes difficult to just have a real centrally managed component or or we provide that guidance um what we do often start with is to think about things in terms of, you know, whenever you're offering a service to think about a read only role and a read write role um so that you can already start to. Create those populations uh and then as you move and promote policies through your stack, uh, to really look at, OK, you know what access has not been used, let's cut it all off and test and see if anything breaks, um, and then likewise apply the strictest policies over to production and and give folks, you know, primarily those read only policies as you can. OK. I think, uh, gentlemen left but there is a uh blog that has already been released with an exhaustive list of courses so I did share that uh any other questions? I have 10, there's one right behind you, OK. Is is access analyzer transitive like, can you tell me, hey, um. You have access to this resource but also whatever has access to this resource can be assumed by another identity. Does it have that capability because there's a lot of uh assume roles that happen and sometimes that can get lost, um, as to who really has access because I can assume to a different role and have that access. Access analyzer is not transitive. It gives you the direct access answer, which are the IM roles that can get to this resource directly. Um, we do provide some tooling like an Amazon Detective that allows you to trace deeper into the the the role, the role chaining paths if there's a particular incident you need to release, and I would recommend you are in the right place. This is the expo. Um, a lot of the partner integrations with Access Analyzer take what its data one step further and link them not only to the chains but to the identities in your corporate directory depending because they have the data about how your IDP is connected in, um, and I, so I would you there are a bunch of vendors here on the floor who would be I'm sure happy to demo those those sequences and and see if those tools are the best, you know, take the access analyze your data and elevate it for your needs. And, and Yeah, and, and that's exactly the issue is that ABS sort of we, we can cover our stack, but for the vast majority of, of corporate uh uh customers. Employees are coming in through an external IDP. Like that's it's just not within our purview. Jay, you had a question. Oh. Does anyone else have a question doesn't work for does not count. You have a question. No. All right. Does anybody else have a question? Anyone? No, I just, uh, the, I think extension of. MFA on all more root users I suppose we got what central management of root uh reinvent I believe and now for member accounts we're sort of uh adding that uh capability as well so that that was my only interest. I totally appreciate that that's your question because this was literally my favorite part of the keynote when Amy got up there and pointed out that we reached 100% enforcement on credentials requiring MFA. Uh, that happened earlier this year. This is a journey we've been on since the fall of 2023 when we announced our intent to start enforcing MFA, and we've been doing so gradually with tranches of accounts, making sure we introduce the features that you needed to apply MFA to those all of those accounts easily, and we know a lot of you, I see someone in particular have a lot of AWS accounts organized into your organization and the last thing you were gonna want to do was apply MFA to every single one. And so at reinvent as you said, Jay, we get, we introduced the central route access management features so you could remove the root credentials of all the member accounts in your org. This is the best security win-win I know because it reduces your surface area, the credentials you have to protect, so your, your, your job just got smaller and it's more secure as a result because those powerful credentials aren't out there. Um, so with this feature in hand, I said I, I think I can say this, it's one of the fastest adopted features I've seen in the identity landscape because it was just such an obvious way to go if you had a lot of accounts to get rid of those root creds completely. Um, if you still have them on your member accounts, we did start enforcing MFA for them. That is how we got to 100%. So now is now is a better time than any if you haven't already removed the root creds from your member accounts. It's a hugely exciting milestone, and, uh, there's more to come to secure authentication. Any final shots? Alright, we have 2 minutes. Kevin, uh, let's do a bonus round. Kevin, what was your favorite announcement that wasn't in the keynote? Wow, so I, yeah, most folks don't know a lot of stuff does not make it into the keynote and is, uh, really probably my most favorite, uh, announcement that did not come out is with Amazon verified permissions. That's our fine grained authorization platform, uh, for the apps that you build. They dropped the price 97%. It went from $150 per million requests to $5. And then, uh, they also announced just today, uh, framework support for Node JS. So it used to be that with, if you wanted to integrate fine-grained authorization into your app, you had to either do it through like an API gateway or call in is authorized endpoint. But they actually changed that. So it's now built into like no JS Express JS framework. You, you do a little command line, it installs a middleware component right inside your app and you can remove all permissions from your code. It's super exciting. Awesome. How about you, Karen? All right, vote us round for me. My favorite announcement that didn't make the keynote. If you do compliance for a living, you know that compliance does not get all the shiny news coverage like generative AI does, but, uh, we, we launched 7 new compliance framework mappings in our control catalog. So if you're trying to achieve compliance with a particular framework, one of those 7 frameworks, you can actually. Just search for it and see all the controls that map to it and much more easily understand which ones you need to enable to achieve the compliance regime that you're trying to reach um this is available now and you can see the results in the in in control tower but also outside of control tower if you don't use it to make sure that you have the data you need to achieve the compliance that you're looking to do. I'd like to give a special shout out to compliance because of course it's really important that you get identity and access right, but your auditors wanna know that you did. So making sure you can show them the that data is, is a part a part of the journey that you get to at the end. All right, Jake, closing shots from anyone before we wrap this up. Question. Awesome. Well, thank, thank you for uh being here to hear a little bit more about the keynote and, uh, please enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you Thank you guys.
