## Summary
This session, presented by Soumya Sagiri, Principal Privacy Security Engineer at AWS, focuses on transforming security incidents from crisis situations into opportunities for organizational growth and improvement. The presentation introduces the concept of reframing security events from reactive firefighting into proactive learning experiences that can enhance competencies and reduce future security risks.

The main technical concept addressed is the Correction of Error (COE) mechanism, which provides a systematic approach to analyzing and learning from security incidents. The presentation explores how this mechanism, along with other approaches like one-way/two-way door decisions and working backwards, can help organizations better handle security events and turn them into value-adding opportunities.

The session uses a real-world scenario involving an AWS IAM Access Analyzer alert for over-privileged Lambda functions to demonstrate how the COE mechanism can be practically applied. It emphasizes the importance of analyzing incidents through multiple lenses - technical gaps, security best practices, and process improvements - to create more robust and secure systems while delivering business value.

## Key Points
- Security incidents should be viewed as opportunities for growth rather than just crises
- The COE mechanism provides a structured approach to learning from security events
- Everything fails eventually - systems should be built with this understanding
- Post-incident analysis should focus on systematic improvements rather than blame
- Mechanisms are more reliable than good intentions for improving security
- The Japanese concept of Kintsugi (repairing pottery with gold) serves as an analogy for turning security incidents into valuable learning experiences
- Multiple perspectives (technical, security, process) should be considered when analyzing incidents
- Proper escalation paths and decision-making processes are crucial for incident management
- Least privilege principle is a fundamental security best practice
- Regular review and improvement of security mechanisms leads to better outcomes

## Technical Details
- AWS IAM Access Analyzer is used for identifying excessive permissions
- Lambda function deployment processes and permission management
- Implementation of least privilege principle in IAM policies
- One-way vs. Two-way door decisions in security architecture

Hello everyone. Thanks for joining me here today. Welcome. So I'm myself Soumya Sagiri, AWS from AWS, Principal Privacy Security Engineer from Seattle, Washington. Today I'm here to dive deep into how to reframe security events as a value add. And we will be learning in the next 20 minutes about how we reframe the head on fire situation into pivotable knowledge gain and competency enhancing skills and continuous improvements in terms of reducing the security risk and also turning the crisis situation into a uh advantage and business accelerators and enablers. So let's move on to the next slide. So today I will also dive deep into uh the road map or a journey we are going to take. It is about. Uh, an agenda. So understand the challenges, reframing the security events like what kind of incidents we are going to face on a day to day basis and how are we actually handling those challenges from a reactive to the proactive mode and acknowledging that there is a reactive aspect of it and then converting that reactive aspect of acknowledging and embracing those challenges and reframing the security events using a one of the best practice. We call it as COE, which is called as correction of error, which is considered as a mechanism. So then how do we use this mechanism, convert that into a pain to gain by using a real world scenario and a real world use case we will see how to apply that COE mechanism towards it. And then we will also know, learn about out of this scenario what kind of key lessons and uh takeaways we're going to learn about it. We will go over. Let's move further. So, OK, you're seeing the phone, a beautiful phone picture like mobile phone, and then there is an alert here. So imagine you at 3 a.m. In the midnight, like early mornings or midnight, you might be receiving uh security alerts or incident alerts, right? Uh, in that situation, like for example, there is a scenario like unauthorized access to your production services, which is an event, and then you are like rushing out of your bed, jolted awake, and then go. Going to the screen and then trying to look into what kind of alert is this are we like it's an adrenal rush constantly updating to look into the details of it and then you're trying to figure it out how to fix it or how to control or contain this event, right? So how many of you actually experience such kind of security events or alerts in your experience? So please raise your hands. Thank you. So, and I acknowledge, and that's very normal, right? So it's like when we have an incident, the impact is very huge and big and we need to actually contain it and control it very fast and very quickly in a right way. So, but now we are. Switching the lens, what happens next is what we are going to learn. So that's where we're going to move forward and how do we convert this into a positive catalyst and enable the growth opportunities for us. It's a post incident event management is what we're gonna see today. So let's move further. So here I want to uh explain you like about you can see on the right hand side, sorry, on the left hand side you can switch and see the phoenix rising from the fire, right? So it's like, you know, you actually encountered an event and an alert or an incident or a breach, you name it, like in a broader way I can call it as an event. Like once the event is contained, so you are like handling from a reactive situation to the. The situation bringing everything into control is like immediate response and stabilization, right? So the post incident analysis, once you stabilize, next you're going to do analysis and learning. What are we going to do? How are we handling? So all those adversaries impact and the techniques they have used, how are we going to evolve out of it and learn from it, right? So and then systematic improvements, what kind of technical scenarios or process gaps we are going to identify and implement continuously to evolve and rise as a Phoenix in much more in a stronger way. So let's move on to the next slide. So, so you can see a famous quote from Werneroggles, the CTO of Amazon, chief technology officer of Amazon. He mentioned a very important quote. Everything fails all the time. If you understand that things can fail, you will build differently. That means it hits the home run, right? I mean, uh, everything fails. Nothing is everlasting. You need to evolve out of it. You need to rip. and build the systems constantly learn from it, identify the growth areas, understand the key problem areas, and also understand where are the root causes enabling such kind of event. So that is where we need to fix the issues that we need to have that mindset of instead of blaming somebody else we need to always have the psychological mindset that everything will fail, but the thing is how do we shift. The mind into reactive problem management to proactive solution identifying and innovation and growth prospective. So let's move further and see this like I wanted to bring up a very important concept, right? In Japan, the artisans use uh broken pottery honoring their past past history, right? You see a beautiful cup here like a bowl. And then this bowl has like if the bowl is broken and then you have cracks, right, honoring the history of that bowl and how much use it has provided and understanding the broken pieces they combine together and they fill those cracks with gold. They make it very valuable. Like it will showcase what we learn from what we broke and and then visible cracks tell stories of the impact and learning and then we honor what it taught. Like even reveal systematic truths we couldn't see and prevention makes us stronger. The repairs which we create and the gold which we have used is more valuable. That means it evolved into priceless and then it it's going to give you more opportunities and also enable this particular pottery. I'm just trying to compare the analogy of broken pottery with the. The incident response right here. So the event happened and then what are the these kind of systematic learnings, whatever you're carrying forward is going to build you that valuable bowl filled with gold. The cracks are filled and then we can reutilize that and then this becomes so valuable that you are actually um prevent any kind of occurrences in the future with the same problem happens. Let's move further. So I wanted to talk about the most important thing here is about the mechanisms, right? Mechanisms is like, let me share what makes great teams even better, like, you know, so no matter how talented your people are, and then I know we all work with incredibly skilled professionals and having a strong mechanisms helps helps everyone perform at their peak performance consistently. Think of it like a professional. Sports team, right, they keep learning these techniques and using this high definition sports relay constantly correcting their errors and mistakes, playing it, and then getting stronger at it, how to outperform their opponents. So the similar way these mechanisms don't diminish their talent, they enhance it. They also provide foundation for the innovation and flourish while maintaining reliability and. On our mechanisms are the bridge between operational efficiency and innovation and sustainability. So for the teams to operate from the better to the best mechanisms are going to be stabilizing this process and then constantly helping the teams to work closely and bring efficiency and also enable consistent innovation. So how do we leverage these mechanisms we're going to see going ahead. And then you can see mechanisms are not mechanisms versus not good intentions, right? Everyone always try to think positive. They will have a good intentions, but how much good intentions the teams have it most of the time because of diverse perspectives or lack of knowledge or process constraints, they might go into sideways. So how do we fix that problem? One of the ways mechanisms, the mechanism is like inputs as you've seen in the previous slide inputs, tools, systems. And processes which are all together validation brings out the outputs, right? So there are different kinds of mechanisms. One of these is correction of error. Today we're going to cover in depth about that. And the second one is one-way or two-way audition, working backwards and tenants. Let's see this correction of error is something like having a high definition replay in sports, as I mentioned earlier, we don't just move mistakes. I mean, we just move from the past mistakes. We steady them, improve our game constantly. Right, so that's what is correction error. We will actually go dive deep into this and how it's a powerful mechanism, how we are going to use this. I will show it one way or two way do decision. One way is like think about it. I wanted to give you two scenarios. One is like stateless packet filtering like firewalls, right? Firewalls you're using VAF rules you're using it. If you, you're blocking a set of IP addresses which are exposed in a secured incident and you're blocking them completely and then reversing that to like. Taking a decision of blocking them in totality and then fixing going back and enabling them is a costly a fire, right, because it's like you need to investigate it, you need to make sure they're safe enough and a lot of investment of time happens there but two way door decision is like very powerful, right? Think about it like a temporary contractors time I mean you are giving a specific time limit for the access control policies for them to procure an access or launching a product in a specific geography and testing them instead of launching. A global platform and which you face the regulations at the later stage and you need to reverse it back. It's going to be very cost intensive. That's why it's very important you want to make one way decision or two-way door decisions. And then COE also enables working backwards. Working backwards is something like, you know, you have a destination in your mind and you wanted to have a road map and then you wanted to take that road map, build an itinerary, and what kind of mode of transportation, how much cost is going to incur. And how are you going to reach that destination is what the working backward is like we work with the customers or your stakeholders or your business teams or other business units solving this particular problems in a constructive way to build scalable solutions and tenants is something very important like uh in in case of high uncertainty and ambiguity you build rules that how to operate effectively within your boundaries. That's what this tenants mechanism. So let's move further. And then correction of error. So correction of error is let's explore the correction of error or COEs or go to mechanism and systematically turning security incidents into continuous improvements. This is a mechanism for education, transparency, improvement, and growth. So let me ask you something. When was the last time you discussed, discovered a flaw and thought it was like I wish I had caught this sooner in the process right? so we always think about it, right? So we think like, OK, oh I haven't done enough research and the earlier in the later stage I was able to figure this thing out already the mistake happened. Now how do I correct and I make sure that these mistakes are not are error. are not happening in a consistent manner and control the bleeding or control the issue scope of the issue uh impacting other areas, right? So let's move and dive deep into this scenario on correction of errors and use cases. We will go back to that 3 a.m. security alert and we will use as a diving deep into the scenario. So let's move further, um. Here correction of error is a systematic process, as I said, it's a mechanism and that identifies operational incidents, whatever the incident happened, identifying the problem and performing the root cause analysis, it's like 5 Ys or fish bone diagram kind of like understanding every single why until you find what exactly triggered that incident or an event and implements preventive controls to eliminate the error occurrence. So I'm segueing and pivoting into the structure, how the correction of error structure looks like here. It's like you have summary metrics, customer impact, incident response analysis, post-incident analysis, and timeline and 5 eyes and lessons learned, right? So there are so many aspects to it. And then it's not about, you know, we each, each one unreveals who actually what made this thing to happen or which team actually uh have a gap to to. Actually triggered this incident or what external factor actually impacted this. You're going to look into many scenarios around this, but I'm going to consider three important things out of this as the impact, timeline, and 5 wise, and eventually they will lead to the takeaways and lessons learned. So let's remember that 7 a.m. unauthorized access to the production servers, right? So let's go back and see, dive deep into a hypothetical 3 a.m. scenario. Like here what happened is let's put COE into action with the real world use case probably feels familiar to many of you. Our AWS IAM Access Analyzer flagged a lambda deployment with excessive permissions, an over privileged function that could have created security risks and it sounds routine, right, but there were in interest. Instead of treating this as another security flaw, we are looking at 3 aspects to solve here. The lambda deployment provided excessive permissions. One is the technical gap, and the second one is security best practice gap. The best practice gap is about like the IAM access analyzer flag the risk, which we do not provide the least privileged principle is not enabled. Here and the third one is the escalations where we are trying to see process improvement. How can you deploy this thing, how the system deployment process can be enabled? Who are the validators, who are the decision makers who need to be this needs to be escalated, and how is the executive supporting on this thing? What kind of roles or racy chats need to be created for this to mitigate this, right? So this is the scenario. So let's move further and then go, let's go back to that RCOE mechanism like we have seen. Uh, I picked from the structure three important things. One is the impact and one is the um like root cause analysis and 3 ways, right? So, uh, and then we will look at customer impact, business impact, security impact. Customer impact is like how is your stakeholder experience looks like and business impact. I like, you know, how are the operations and delivery and security impact is like what kind of risks we are going to experience out of this and then reliability impact is how sustainable and scalable your systems are performing at the uh are you able to have the business continuity if it is exposed and then cost optimization if you make the resources access permission changes, what is my consumption looks like right? so. This is about impact and then timeline of series. In this you see the timeline of series from June 1st to June 15th, uh, like you see there are two important things to look into it. One is the process optimization and the other one is pattern recognition, right? So the lambda function deployed excessive IIM permissions was identified on June 1st and then June. 5th, actually the risk was flagged by IM analyzer. Let's say for example, the opportunity is here is a pattern recognition. Pattern recognition is nothing but automation opportunities that how can you automate to trigger this uh flag as soon as possible on the same time when it was deployed. And second one is the process optimization. Process optimization is nothing but meantime to, uh, meantime to fix or mean time to resolve. One is to mean time to. Identify and meantime to resolve, right? So these kind of techniques you need to use in terms of understanding the timeline series, what exactly happened the whole whole scenario from it day one to day end, how are we resolving this thing, right? So let's move further. So if you can look into this, like the root cause analysis, as I said, it's like similar like a fish bone diagram. You need to keep asking first, why, second, why, 3rd, why, 4th and 5th why until you identify all. Problem areas. One is excessive permissions, and then second one, second one is like you, you need to actually create a least privilege removing all the wildcards for the resources you are trying to provide access. And third is about understanding the required IIM permissions, creating a racy chart. And 4th 1 is providing a comprehensive guidelines and training material for your employees to understand their permissions. And 5th is like you need to have a bar raiser or a security validation kind of process. And then now we're coming to the corrective actions whatever I have explained earlier, like you can see here excessive permissions and then uh validation tools to be enabled and then security training and certification program developing comprehensive security best practices and then making sure that you have a launching a barrier program or security champion or someone in your team actually validating those. Permissions as per your business needs. That is how you're going to correct all these 5 ways. Now you can see the improvements in a constructive order. So you have your business owners can make the decision or your executives or your security experts, engineers can make the decisions about how do they correct it from not only the technical finding point of view, process gaps and which can even lead to further innovation. So then of this all these corrective actions, the team started working together collaboratively and they came back with other teams adapting the lining mode like CFNAag. They identified tools where they can check before even deploying this permissions, right, and then spanned spanned across cross organization working groups. Emission hygiene. So not only about sharing the guard rails, you have a centralized team you have created called the Center of Excellence, and the guard rails are built and then these guard rails are deployed by using a dev kit which was built for scaling through other business units and business organizations for their consumption. And then that's how the COE initiative has been widely adapted and have a positive impact on the organization technology practices, improving core quality, security, and operational efficiency. It is not only the security, it is going to impact other parts of the organizations and other domains as well. So finally, um, instant response is a team sport and it is all about speed to resolution and reduces response time from data to minutes from harassment from GSS, uh, from Amazon Web Services. It's all about, you know, you build the efficiency by working together collectively and bring the results, uh, by utilizing these mechanisms. And then these are the key takeaways. So the one is a feedback loop loop you're establishing two, two-way door mechanisms and the tenants to operate in high certainty environment and building working backwards with your stakeholders and customers constantly. And then these are the cultural reinforcement and the shift of the mindset I said it's not only about fixing the security problems, but it is also translate one of fixes into shareable solutions and transform customer relationships and also COE is a teaching tool and it is along with the mechanism and it is not a blaming tool or pointing fingers at each other. So this is a mechanism to scale the culture and it is not only about the code. And then I wanted to give you a learning resource. Now you have seen how the COE mechanism works. So in a structured way, you can deep dive into this by using this uh uh available AWS blog post, and then you can just start implementing this right away in your organization where you can see the results and then you can start identifying the opportunities going forward. So Thank you very much for your attention and time here today and have a wonderful day and happy to connect. Have a nice day. Thank you.
