## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session addresses the critical mindset shift required when transitioning from traditional on-premises security to cloud-native security paradigms. Delivered by Hunter, an AWS Solutions Architect, the presentation challenges organizations to move beyond centralized security models to embrace distributed security ownership where every team member becomes responsible for security within their domain.

The session emphasizes the fundamental difference between traditional on-premises security (where customers own the full security stack) and AWS cloud security (where responsibilities are shared through the AWS Shared Responsibility Model). The core message centers on transforming security from a blocking function managed by a single team into an enabling capability distributed across the entire organization. This transformation requires building a "culture of security" where security becomes everyone's responsibility rather than remaining isolated within a dedicated security department.

The presentation outlines a maturation model progressing from IT-dependent security (where all security questions go to IT) through centralized security teams to product owner empowerment, ultimately reaching the "athlete" level where every individual owns their security posture. This evolution is supported by four key components: communication and education, executive support, distributed ownership, and psychological safety that encourages proactive security concern reporting without fear of repercussions.

## Key Points
- Traditional on-premises security requires customers to own and manage the complete security stack with full responsibility for monitoring and controls
- AWS shared responsibility model divides security into "security of the cloud" (AWS responsibility) and "security in the cloud" (customer responsibility)
- Security should be viewed as an enabler for business innovation rather than a blocking function managed by a single team
- Culture of security (organization-wide security mindset) differs from security culture (security team's internal culture)
- Evolution from IT-dependent security through centralized teams to distributed ownership with individual security responsibility
- 49% of CEOs cite cyber risk as top concern, with 88% of boards viewing cybersecurity as business risk rather than technical risk
- SEC requirements now mandate disclosure of cybersecurity incidents and risk management strategies in annual reports
- Psychological safety enables proactive security concern reporting without fear of negative consequences
- Executive support is essential for successful organization-wide security culture transformation
- Security ownership maturity progresses through baby (IT-dependent), security team, adults (product owners), to athlete (individual ownership) stages

## Technical Details
- **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS manages infrastructure security (host OS, virtualization layer, physical facilities) while customers handle application security, data encryption, network configuration, and access management
- **Security Architecture Transition**: Move from monolithic security controls to distributed, service-integrated security measures using AWS native services
- **Automation Integration**: Leverage built-in AWS security services and automated compliance tools rather than rebuilding custom security platforms
- **Communication Framework**: Establish organization-wide security education programs and clear communication channels for security concerns
- **Executive Governance**: Implement executive-level security oversight with clear accountability frameworks and business risk integration
- **Distributed Ownership Model**: Define security responsibilities at team and individual levels with appropriate tooling and automation access
- **Psychological Safety Implementation**: Create reporting mechanisms for security concerns without punitive consequences, encouraging proactive threat identification
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing security assessment and improvement processes rather than one-time security reviews
- **Business Continuity Integration**: Align security practices with business continuity requirements and regulatory compliance obligations
- **Cultural Transformation Strategy**: Systematic approach to changing organizational security mindset from reactive compliance to proactive strategic advantage
- **Risk Management Evolution**: Transform from centralized CISO decision-making to empowered team-level security decision-making with appropriate guardrails
- **Security Tooling Philosophy**: Adopt proven, purpose-built security solutions rather than building differentiating security tools from scratch

## Full Transcript

Hello everyone. Thanks for joining me today. As you said, we'll be covering transitioning security mindsets from a traditional on-premise mindset to a more cloud native mindset, uh, particularly when migrating from like an on-prem environment to AWS. Real quick, let's cover sort of what we'll be talking about. So the on-premise, you know, security paradigms versus AWS security paradigms we'll cover some of that and then we'll go over the AWS shared responsibility model, a model that we encourage all of our customers to review and be familiar with when leveraging AWS services, and then we'll, we'll step into sort of the culture of security and transforming organizations as a whole when it comes to that security mindset and how they view their culture of security. And then we'll lead into some next steps, sort of what you take away from this. You can go ahead and jump in here with sort of those traditional on on-premise security paradigms right where you as the customer, you're responsible for the full stack of observation, you know, monitoring, implementing those security controls. You own all of it. You're responsible for all of it. Offloading can be a pain, and then when you, when you have audits and compliance requirements you introduce another layer of complexity there. And with a cloud native, you know, security paradigms in AWS you have shared security responsibilities so you can offload some of the infrastructure security piece and then use built in security controls and automated security services that are typically built in and able to be leveraged very easily with AWS services and then automated compliance tools and continuous monitoring built into those services as well. So back to that shared responsibility model that I spoke about. This is really what we encourage customers to become familiar with when they look at migrating to AWS, right, where a lot of we we refer to it AWS is responsible for security of the cloud, so all of the underlying cloud infrastructure and and providing a secure service for you all to use and then the customer is responsible for leveraging those services in a secure manner, right, encrypting customer data properly, making sure encryption is enabled in transit and and configuring your network stack in a secure manner. Um, So let's talk about a bit about you know cultural and organizational transformation when it comes to changing that security mindset from on prem to AWS um what I what I like to say when it comes to adopting security tools is don't recreate them if the security tool isn't your business's differentiator, why recreate it? Why rebuild it, use something that's proven. Um, and AWS has a lot of built in native services that enable you to take advantage of that and really what we want to see customers do when when moving to the cloud is make security everyone's responsibility. So instead of having a centralized security team or, or, you know, person within the business, secure everyone should be focused on security. So product teams, developers, everyone should have that in mind when building out on on top of AWS and on the cloud. And that will enable, you know, the product teams and the the organization as a whole to focus on innovation and and reinvention as opposed to implementing security tools and and platforms that aren't setting the business apart, right? Why why focus time on a security tool when you want to be building your product, the the thing that sets you apart from your competitors and advancing in the industry. And what we see is a common denominator for success, particularly with customers migrating to AWS, is building a culture of security. So it's not the technical ability of the customer, it's not the tools they select, it's how you form your culture around the cloud and how you look at security as a whole, again, sort of enabling everyone in the company to be familiar with the security procedures and and making everyone an owner of security as opposed to having a single security team. Right, and we, we wanna make that mindset an enabler for the business as opposed to letting security be a blocker typically we see, you know, security can be a bit of a blocker for some companies. It should be the opposite. Security should be an enabler. It should enable those those teams to feel comfortable putting out a, a service or a product that they're, you know, sure that is secure. Next we'll sort of touch on culture of security versus security culture, right? And we, we make sure to delineate that at Amazon, right? Culture of security is the entire company how they view security, what security means to the entire company, whereas security culture is talking about. The culture of that specific security team of your security team, right? How does the security team view security and uh culture of security is how does the business look at security? Is everyone familiar, um, is everyone comfortable with security and, and putting that as a priority when they're building. And then we'll, we'll jump into a bit more of that making security you right security is a concern greater than just that that individual team and those individual people. um, we see PWC noted that 49% of CEOs, uh, cited cyber risk as a top concern in their 2022 survey. Similarly, Gartner noted that 88% of board of directors view cybersecurity as a business risk rather than just a technical risk, so it's, it's impacting the business as a whole, not just the products and services that teams are using or building on. And then the SEC published recently, right, requiring disclosure of any cybersecurity incidents and then further disclosure of the registrants cybersecurity risk management strategy and governance in their annual reports. So we can see security is taking on a more hol. Business role as opposed to just the technical teams that are focused on security and we view that as a good thing right? Security shouldn't be centralized and in one place where uh a security team feels overwhelmed feels like they can't hire enough people to to meet that demand for the company. Right, and we have Gartner also noting that by 2025, a single centralized cybersecurity function isn't agile enough to meet the demands of of modern organizations or digital organizations. So CISOs, you know, they have to reconceptualize that responsibility matrix and enable CEOs and other executives to make their own decisions in a a comfortable environment, um, having security at top of mind as opposed to always deferring to the, the CSO to make those decisions for them. Um Right, and the, the challenge that that many organizations think security only belongs to that security department and realistically we want everyone in the organization to be responsible for security of their own team, their own products, and be comfortable, right? They should be familiar with the tooling and be able to put out a secure product, um. So we'll jump into sort of what is the evolution of security ownership look like at a business that's moving more towards a cloud native security mindset or a decentralized security mindset. So we've got someone in IT, right, is the the baby. This is where whenever you have a security question, whenever you need to, you know, ask some security thing or run through some security review, you run back to the IT team. The IT team's responsible for it. They own all of the tooling. They're the ones that are familiar as opposed to having a platform where any, you know, product team can go in and and manage their own sort of. Security piece. The next step within that evolution there would be the security team. So you have a centralized security team. They're working on building out those automations and the tooling for other teams to take advantage of, but they're still the primary owners. They're still primarily responsible for the security of the entire organization. And then next we have the adults so the the product owners. This is where things really start to change. There's enough automation and tooling in place. The company's familiar with it. The organization as a whole is familiar with the the tooling. You still have the security team advising on how to use some of the tooling, how to implement properly, but product owners and product teams really feel safe and and. Encouraged to use that tooling in an automated manner um for performing security reviews testing vulnerability assessment, those sorts of things and then our end goal here is an athlete where everyone's responsible for security within their org everyone's empowered to implement, you know, automated tooling within their product suite and and within their own teams. And everyone owns sort of their own security posture uh throughout the organization leading to a more secure uh posture overall throughout the the organization. What we also see are there there are 4 key components when it comes to building that culture of security as opposed to a security culture. The first being communication and education, right? We have to enable people, we have to communicate and be able to communicate throughout the org as well as educate the the employees within an organization, um. And then second to that is executive support. If you don't have executive buy-in, it's it's hard to push any initiative throughout the org and, and you really need, you know, the executive team on board with pushing security first as opposed to just having a security team, just having a dedicated security function within the org. And then after that we step into that more distributed ownership model, so where everyone's responsible for their own security posture, everyone's enabled to take advantage of those automations and tooling. And really changing from a single threaded owner uh for security to the entire org owning their security posture. Right, and then the, the last and arguably one of the most important steps is psychological safety, right? Everyone should feel empowered to call out a security concern or bring a security concern to the security team or to their owner for security, uh, without the, the fear of, you know, repercussions or or. Any negative impact of that security threats and and bringing those to attention should be viewed as a good thing, right? We want to become aware before it gets launched or before it's in a place where it can actually be taken advantage of, right? Catch it internally before we release the product, um, and that's where the psychological safety comes in. Everyone should feel empowered to to bring up issues within the or developers, product owners, team members, whoever it may be. and then We've got some, some key next steps here, right? Uh, I'll leave this up for a minute while I talk about this. So the AWS shared responsibility model again, going back to that, uh, that model that we saw earlier in the slides where AWS is responsible for security of the cloud and, and ensuring that you will have a. Platform to build on top of or secure service to build on top of whereas customers maintain that ownership of security in the cloud so how you build applications in the cloud, how you encrypt data and transit in at rest and um you know how you store your data segregated between different customers, those sorts of things. And then we've got a a link to AWS security for executives. So how do you position security from an executive lens as opposed to a more technical lens? And then lastly that that culture of security which is really gonna be again we want to build a culture of security within organizations as opposed to a a strong security culture, uh, taking that back to. The the culture of security is the entire or. How does the entire organization view security, uh, and the culture of security is, you know, what is the, the culture of the security team. I appreciate you all coming out. It's great, um, talking to you all today. Thank you all for joining me again. Again, my name is Hunter. I'm a solutions architect at AWS. It's great talking to you all. Thanks, everyone.
