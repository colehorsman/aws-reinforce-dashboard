## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session (SEC225) is a strategic keynote by a leader from Accenture's emerging tech security practice, focusing on preparing for future cybersecurity challenges rather than reacting to them. The speaker emphasizes that emerging technologies follow a "gradually, then suddenly" adoption pattern, making it crucial to identify and prepare for new risks during their slow growth phase before they reach inflection points.

The presentation covers major emerging threats including post-quantum computing (which will break current RSA and elliptic curve cryptography by 2030-2035), explosive IoT growth, sophisticated criminal organizations, and AI/regulatory challenges. However, the core message is optimistic: traditional cybersecurity fundamentals like patching, least privilege, segmentation, and defense-in-depth remain effective against new threats. The speaker advocates for a generalist approach to security, emphasizing that doing the basics well while gradually adapting to new technologies is more effective than trying to solve everything perfectly at once. The talk concludes with practical advice about trade-offs, business alignment, and the importance of rest and quality decision-making for security professionals.

## Key Points
- Future technologies follow a "gradually, then suddenly" adoption curve that makes inflection points visible only in retrospect
- Post-quantum computers threaten all RSA and elliptic curve cryptography, with official deprecation by 2030 and prohibition by 2035
- IoT growth continues explosively with 127 new devices coming online every second as of 2021
- Modern attackers include sophisticated criminal gangs operating globally, not just curious kids and state actors
- Traditional cybersecurity fundamentals (patching, least privilege, segmentation, monitoring) remain highly effective against emerging threats
- "Good and complete beats perfect and unfinished" - start with what you know while learning new approaches
- Assume breaches will happen and focus on response planning rather than 100% prevention
- Generalist security professionals are more resilient and can spot patterns across domains that specialists might miss

## Technical Details

All right, um, I'm gonna go ahead and get started then. Uh, thanks everybody for showing up. Uh, tonight I'm gonna, I don't have a product to pitch you. I don't really even have a service to pitch you. This is more of a public service announcement in about a 20 minute form. So I lead Accenture's emerging tech security practice in the Americas, so mostly quantum and space, but we do a fair amount of other stuff as well. I used to be an Amazonian, so I spent a lot of time connecting threads between what's coming and what's already here, trying to help people be prepared for things rather than reacting to them after the fact. So I'm gonna talk a little bit today. It's gonna be a little different than a lot of the other topics you're gonna hear at Reinforce. Um, we're gonna talk about. How we approach problems, how we think about problem solving, what we can learn from history, and why we don't need to be afraid or nervous about new stuff that's coming out. We can be confident in our ability to respond based on what we already know. With apologies to Ernest Hemingway, um, who was once asked in one of his books, how did you go bankrupt? And he said two ways gradually, then suddenly, um, that's the way the future comes. It happens gradually and then it hits us all at once. The problem is that the all at once part is only visible in the rearview. We don't recognize what that looks like until after it's happened. So most new technologies have a development and adoption curve that looks like a hockey stick, be a gradual progress for quite a while, and then you have some inflection points that are followed by exponential growth. Usually those are not visible until after they've happened. So the challenge for us as security professionals is to identify new risks while they're still in the slow growth phase. By the time the inflection point is visible, defenders are reacting rather than preventing. Bruce Schneier says attacks always get better, they never get worse. Nobody ever woke up with fewer security issues to work about, worry about than they had the day before. This background image was generated for an earlier version of this talk by Stability AI. This was before the wildfires of January 2025 that were near my home in Southern California, and that talk was at that point titled Cyber Security is a Forest Fire, and all I have is a garden hose. I changed it because it was a little too close to home. So cybersecurity, not getting easier, getting more difficult, getting more complicated, higher stakes, more things online all the time. Um, I'm gonna walk you through some of these things. The cost of a failure or a breach is higher now than it's ever been. It only grows as we get more and more of our society's critical functions moving online. As the pool of attackers and the scope of assets under protection both grow, the likelihood of a breach becomes a near certainty. Um, I'm particularly fond of talking about post quantum encryption. I'm gonna talk about quantum security a little bit more on the next slide, but, um, if you follow the space at all, this last 12 months has been incredibly eventful. This last 6 months has been incredibly eventful for new capability developments, um, not just in quantum security hardware and error correction, but also in algorithmic improvements and. Distributed computing breakthroughs. There's a lot of things that are happening that are moving the day when we will have to contend with a what we call a cryptographically relevant quantum computer, something that can factor RSA. It is coming sooner than we thought. Um, a year ago, most experts thought 2032, 2033, more likely than not. We've had a lot of breakthroughs, especially around the first part of this year, and then Google's paper from a few weeks ago. So every time we have one of these breakthroughs, it becomes more likely that it's going to hit us sooner rather than later. Internet of things, those of you who deal with cybery with IoT and OT stuff. As of 2021, we had 127 new IOT devices that went online every second. Western households have on average 20 plus internet capable devices. 70% of all TVs sold are smart, and this, like I said, was all 4 years ago. Attackers are getting better. 30 years ago when I was getting started, it was curious kids and state actors. Now it's criminal gangs of all sizes operating anywhere on the planet. Willie Sutton, a 100 years ago was asked, Why do you rob banks? And he said, it's because that's where the money is. Criminals are still operating by that maxim. Growth in number and sophistication of attackers mirrors the growth of internet connected networks in both number of devices and financial impact. Gen AI can't go 2 seconds without somebody mentioning it. I'm gonna skip over it relatively quickly. You're gonna hear a ton about it the whole time that you're here. One of my colleagues in the back does nothing but AI all the time. Um, there's a lot of people that are here to talk to you about securing models, securing how things work. I like to think about it less around the security of the technical underpinnings and more about how do I trust the business logic that involves AI output if I assume that there's going to be failures in that, how can I architect the way that I function so that even if there's a failure, I still don't have a business outage. Regulations. I spent a ton of time helping people deal with regulatory compliance. That thing changes all the time. Um, post quantum stuff I was talking about a minute ago is driving tons of regulatory change. The regulations tend to trail behind new technology, so when new tech comes out, defenders have already been trying to mitigate risk for several years without the help of any legal frameworks. Then the frameworks come along. And now you're trying to mitigate threat and deal with new compliance requirements, so Regulators try to help, but frequently it ends up just adding more work on the plate of defenders and all of this is on top of the responsibilities you already had yesterday. None of that stuff went away. I said I was gonna talk about post quantum briefly, um. The new cryptographic standards that dropped from this back in August of last year, along with a roadmap for deprecating RSA and ECC that came out in November. Pretty much everything that we have that is based on asymmetric public key crypto is deprecated and has to be replaced with new cryptographic suites that are based on a different kind of math problem than factoring large integers. RSA and elliptic curve are officially deprecated by 2030. They're disallowed by 2035. If that sounds like a long time away. It's not as far as you think. How long do you think it would take your org to swap out all the cryptography you have, all the PKI, all the machine identities. In every open source software supply chain, every vendor provided application stack, every operating system, every network end point, every security hardware appliance, what about your cloud vendors? Just maintaining track of all the things that aren't in your direct. Scope is going to be a full time job for a lot of people for a lot of years. Five years sounds like a long time, but it isn't. A lot of orgs are still running. TLS 1.0 was released in '99. It was obsoleted by 1.1 in 2006. It was hard deprecated four years ago. NSA and DOD are urging immediate transition away from this stuff. Deprecating Sha one took more than a decade, so this stuff is not fast. There's two timelines when you're thinking about post quantum. One is around capability development for new quantum computers, which I talked about a little bit before. We've had 5 new releases in about a 4 month time frame earlier this year from Google, from Microsoft, from Amazon, Zuhongzi in China. Dwave second gen system came out 5 different approaches, 5 different vendors, 5 different chips all at about the same time. We're seeing inflection points around capability development that are faster than what even the experts would have predicted a year or two ago. Um, the upper left hand corner there is Cloudflare radar, which is a great resource for everybody. It's open source intelligence based on cloudflare's visibility on the internet. They run about 20% of all internet traffic, and they make most of their observability and metrics publicly available. So this was 2 months ago. They were already running nearly 40% of all. Of their HTTPS traffic was TLS 1.3 and it was negotiating post quantum cipher suits, and that's because Cloud Flour rolled it out years ago and as soon as Google Chrome rolled it out, it just kind of silently automatically worked. That's what we want things to look like is for stuff to come out for users to not have to do anything and to have it just work. Um, upper right is quantum computing capability over time. I talked about that. Lower right is the uh MIT quantum economic advantage calculator. Plug in the hardware that you care about, plug in the math problem that you want to solve by factoring large integers, and the calculator will figure out at what point in time is it going to be cheaper and faster to do it on a quantum computer than a regular one. For those of you who are interested, I also recommend Googling an MIT's technology review from about a year and a half ago. Google DeepMind solved a previously unsolvable math problem called the capset problem. And one of my friends said it's not the application of Schre's algorithm on a quantum computer I'm worried about. It's an AI discovering a new and unexpected approach that changes the game overnight, leverages what we already have, as well as what's coming, and it cuts our collapse time from 10 years down to zero. So that was uh not the good news, that was the bad news. Now I'm gonna give you the good news. This is one of a few species of tree that is highly resilient in the face of forest fires, so we're going to talk about resilience for a minute and what that looks like. Don't panic. Most of the stuff I talked about just now seems new. Um, a lot of the quantum stuff sounds like sci-fi to a lot of people still. um, this stuff may appear exotic and confusing, but the way that we mitigate it and deal with it is going to be very familiar to most of you. It's the stuff that we already know how to do. It turns out that it's really effective to do the stuff that you already know how to do. Common sense approaches from the past. They worked in the past. They still work today. Learn to use the classics. That means follow the best practices that have been established for years, patching, least privileged, segmentation, robust monitoring, secure defaults, defense in depth. In addition to applying new mitigation techniques like. New post quantum cryptography suites, you need to do what you already know is the right thing to be doing. It doesn't do any good to upgrade the locks with new crypto if you keep leaving all the windows open by publishing your admin credentials to GitHub. Rule 10 good and complete beats perfect and unfinished. You may not have a comprehensive plan yet. That is OK. Most people in this room do not have a comprehensive plan for how to deal with new stuff. The important thing is to get started. You already know things that your team could be doing today. Do what you know while you figure out the rest. Amazon calls this bias for action. See also Rule 22, which is not listed, which says the perfect is the enemy of the good. Don't let an inability to do everything become an excuse to do nothing. Everything fails. Plan accordingly. Thank you, Werner. At some point a breach will happen. It is guaranteed your organization is going to have a breach. So rather than trying to get a 100% prevention against a breach, focus on articulating a plan for how you're going to respond. If you assume it's gonna happen and you plan for it and you practice for it, when it does happen. You're ready to respond. Fire drills are effective for a reason. They're affected because people practice. So think about in practice how you're gonna respond to ransomware or data theft or spear phishing or disclosure of company or customer confidential data. Understand. Who do I need to talk to, you know, in legal? who are my regulators that I need to talk to? How am I gonna respond? What are my backups look like? When did I last practice restoring something from backup? This is stuff that you should be practicing on a regular basis. GAI again trust but verify. You need to think about business risk when you're using this stuff. Gen AI that creates background images for your security talk is, you know, relatively low risk. GAI that produces legal contracts or complicated infrastructures code templates for a production cloud environment that houses your mission critical business applications higher risk. Output is more difficult to verify, so you need less trust and more skepticism. This is not a binary trust it or don't trust it. Think about it as a spectrum of risk. You really need to know your users. It's hard to secure something if you don't understand why it exists, so know your builders, understand why they do what they do, what business outcomes are they chasing, what trade-offs are they thinking about? What are they incentivized for and make sure that the security guard rails that you're building are aligned with the stuff that they already need to do. Ask what is it you're trying to do instead of what problem are you having? The XY problem is one of my favorite things. It frequently is. It presents as people asking the wrong question or presupposing the right question, and it's not relegated solely to tech support. Business leaders and product owners often stumble on this. They will ask how best to do Action X because they think it gets into strategic outcome Y, but because they didn't tell you what it was they're actually trying to do. They may have missed a better way to do it. There's a lot of different inputs that can lead to a given business outcome. I like to tell people that in Amazon there's 6 different ways to do anything. Think about how many databases Amazon runs. Only one of those is gonna be the optimal choice for your particular situation and trade-offs instead of constraints. So it's really important to understand what is the outcome that I'm looking for at a business level and then work backwards to the right set of technology inputs because otherwise you run the risk of building something that is technically correct, scalable, cost effective, etc. etc. But that your business doesn't care about because it doesn't aligned with the thing that they're trying to do. Use the desired outcome to dictate approach and implementation, not the other way around. Rule 3, everything is a trade off. Everything, there is nothing you do that doesn't have a trade off. Everything you say yes to means you're saying no to a bunch of other stuff, so it's really important to understand not just what am I trying to do, but what am I going to say no to in order to prioritize this. If you think something's free, you don't understand the tradeoffs yet. Not all costs are financial. In fact, the biggest costs are often not present in your monthly bill. Costs like opportunity costs, employee quality of life, customer satisfaction, brand image, public goodwill, future positioning, these are all costs, but they're hard to quantify. And when you're making decisions, you need to think about things more than just how many dollars am I going to spend on Macy at the end of the month. Security teams are used to thinking about risks like passing audits and keeping customer and company confidential information safe and defending against incursions and keeping systems and services online. Risks that don't fall into these buckets are easy to overlook. Things like I said, opportunity costs, reputation and brand impact, you need to be thinking about not just is this possible but is this wise? The question isn't just can I do the thing? Can I build the thing, can I, you know, create some amazing work flow with AI, but. Should we even be doing this? What are we saying no to if we say yes to investing time and money into this other thing? The question is never just can we do this, but should we do this? What are we not going to do because we're doing this? What are the implications for partners, customers, competitors? Will this still be important in 5 years? Is now the right time to do it? I'm particularly fond of generalists because that's been my career path. I know a little bit about an awful lot of things. A generalist is somebody that's resilient in the face of surprises and the unknown. A lot of security people are generalists. We gained confidence from having faced a wide variety of different issues before. Uh, David Epstein has a book called Range that I really like, and the intro to that says in most fields, especially those that are complex and unpredictable, generalists, not specialists are primed to excel. They're more creative, more agile, and able to able to make connections that their specialized peers can't see. You know, swift on security is right. Journalists are the ones that know when to call in specialists and give them what they need, so you want to have both kinds of people in your organization, but it's really important to have the people on the front who are looking at stuff every day. Not be so narrowly specialized that they don't recognize patterns from areas that are unfamiliar domains. There's two habits that can really help with this. One is read, read widely, but don't stress over being able to keep up with everything. Your reading list is a river to dip from, not a bucket to empty. Habit two is pay attention to smart people that are outside of your discipline or your specialty. Familiarize yourself with the great mental models. And keep in mind that making the right decision doesn't guarantee the desired outcome. You could do the right thing and still end up with the outcome you don't want. Robert Heinlein, love him or hate him, had a great quote on this. A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, con a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cookie tasty meal, fight efficiently and die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. So how do we do all this stuff? Rest. The decisions that you make are profoundly consequential for yourself, for your team, for your organization, and for your customers, and for some of you, for the general public. You put all those stakeholders at risk if you operate at a deficit mentally, physically or emotionally and bring less than your best judgment. So try to optimize for a smaller number of higher quality decisions slow is smooth, smooth as fast. I have about 15 seconds left. So I'm gonna skip to the appendix and if you want to ask questions or get a copy of this stuff, it will be available. Thank you.
