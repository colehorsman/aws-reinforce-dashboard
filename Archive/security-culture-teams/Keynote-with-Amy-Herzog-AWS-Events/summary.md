>> BEHIND EVERY INNOVATION IS A
TRUTH. IN ORDER TO DREAM BIG, YOU NEED A SECURE FOUNDATION TO
ADVANCE THE FUTURE OF AVIATION WHILE MEETING THE STRICTEST
COMPLIANCE, YOU NEED A CLOUD YOU CAN TRUST TO REDEFINE
TRANSPORTATION. [MUSIC]
YOU NEED RIGOROUS GUARDRAILS SO YOU CAN MOVE FAST AND TO CONNECT
PEOPLE WITH LIFE CHANGING TREATMENTS. YOU NEED POWERFUL,
SCALABLE COMPUTE. [MUSIC]
YOU NEED CLOUD SERVICES THAT ARE MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO BE MORE
SECURE AT AWS, WE START WITH SECURITY AS THE FOUNDATION FOR
EVERYTHING. SO YOU CAN BUILD ANYTHING.
>> PLEASE WELCOME CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER OF
AWS, AMY HERZOG. >> HELLO, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO
THIS YEAR'S RE:INFORCE. I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE EVERYONE AND TO
JOIN THIS CONFERENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME AS CISO. WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT RE:INFORCE IS THAT IT FOCUSES ON THE PRACTICAL SKILLS
AND STRATEGIES YOU NEED TO DRIVE SECURE CLOUD INNOVATION. OVER
THE NEXT TWO DAYS, YOU'LL GET TO EXPLORE THE LATEST TOOLS AND
DISCOVER NEW WAYS TO SOLVE COMPLEX SECURITY CHALLENGES
RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE ARCHITECTS WHO BUILD OUR SERVICES. WHILE
I'M NEW TO THE AWS CISO ROLE, MY JOURNEY WITH AWS STRETCHES A
WHILE BACK AND INNOVATION AND AGILITY HAVE BEEN AT THE HEART
OF ALL OF IT. I FIRST HEARD OF AWS AT THE VERY BEGINNING. I
MEAN THE VERY BEGINNING. WHILE I WAS AT MITRE HELPING GOVERNMENT
CUSTOMERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CLOUD THING WAS AND HOW THEY
SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE SECURITY OF IT. AFTER MITRE, AWS POWERED
MY STARTUPS, AND IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE TO SAY THEY COULDN'T
HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT IT. LIKE SECRET IT BUDGETS ARE NOT SUPER
HIGH ON THE LIST OF STARTUP PRIORITIES. THESE PAST TWO PLUS
YEARS, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO RELY ON AWS AS AN ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER.
JUST AS MANY OF YOU AS JUST AS MANY OF YOU DO. IN FACT, I'VE
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF RELYING ON AWS AS MULTIPLE ENTERPRISE
CUSTOMERS BECAUSE I WAS THE CISO FOR MULTIPLE BUSINESSES, FROM
MOVIE STUDIOS TO CONSUMER DEVICES TO OUR ADVERTISING
BUSINESS AND BEYOND. THE THROUGH LINE OF ALL OF MY EXPERIENCES
WITH AWS IS THAT ALL OF YOU ARE CUSTOMERS DRIVE OUR WORK, AND WE
RELENTLESSLY INNOVATE TO MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND EARN YOUR
TRUST. WE KNOW THAT SECURITY IS AT THE HEART OF YOUR
EXPECTATIONS FOR US. LAST YEAR HERE, WE SPOKE ABOUT OUR
SECURITY CULTURE AND HOW IT MOTIVATES AND INTEGRATES INTO
EVERY TEAM. HERE AT AWS. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN SECURE BY DESIGN,
DEFINING INDUSTRY LEADING PRACTICES, TECHNOLOGIES AND
CONTROLS TO HELP ENSURE ROBUST SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION FOR
YOUR APPLICATIONS AND YOUR DATA. BUT OUR CUSTOMER OBSESSION TO
USE ONE OF AMAZON'S LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES DOESN'T STOP THERE.
WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALSO CONTINUALLY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO
GET THE STRONG SECURITY OUTCOMES YOU NEED IN A WAY THAT'S EASIER
AND MORE SCALABLE, ESPECIALLY NOW AS YOU WORK TO ENABLE AI
INITIATIVES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE SECURITY POSTURE. YOU'VE
SPENT YEARS BUILDING. THE PACE OF CHANGE IS NOT SLOWING DOWN.
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WE'RE GOING TO SEE RAPID
TRANSFORMATIONS, COUNTLESS EXPERIMENTS, AND THIS IS HOW IT
GOES. PROBABLY SOME SPECTACULAR FAILURES ALONG THE WAY.
SOMETIMES YOU CAN WORRY THAT AI FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A
REBELLIOUS INTERN WHO MIGHT JUST DECIDE TO REDESIGN YOUR ENTIRE
DATABASE SCHEMA WITHOUT YOU ASKING. BUT HERE'S WHAT I KNOW
TO BE TRUE WE CAN'T PROPERLY SECURE AI OR ANY OTHER
TECHNOLOGY REALLY, WITHOUT A SECURE FOUNDATION. TODAY, I WANT
TO WALK YOU THROUGH JUST A FEW OF THE WAYS WE'RE MAKING IT
EASIER FOR YOU TO ACHIEVE THAT STRONG SECURITY FOUNDATION.
WE'RE GOING TO COVER A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS IDENTITY AND
ACCESS MANAGEMENT, DATA AND NETWORK SECURITY THAT ACTUALLY
SCALES FOR YOU, MONITORING AND INCIDENT RESPONSE THAT KEEPS UP
WITH THE PACE OF CHANGE AND HOW MIGRATING TO THE CLOUD AND
MODERNIZING YOUR TECH STACK CAN GIVE YOU A BETTER SECURITY EDGE.
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, OUR JOB ISN'T TO SLOW DOWN
INNOVATION. IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF US CAN MOVE EVEN
FASTER. LET'S DIVE IN. IN MODERN SYSTEMS, IDENTITY AND ACCESS
MANAGEMENT AREN'T JUST PART OF THE SECURITY STORY. THEY'RE
FOUNDATIONAL TO EVERYTHING YOU DO. IDENTITY IS ABOUT TRUST.
IT'S ABOUT BEING CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO SAY, WE KNOW WHO YOU
ARE, AND THEREFORE WE KNOW WHAT YOU CAN ACCESS. IT'S A REALLY
SIMPLE MENTAL MODEL, BUT THE SYSTEMS THAT WE NEED TO APPLY
THAT MENTAL MODEL TO ARE OFTEN PRETTY COMPLICATED. AND AS
BUSINESSES GROW, SO DOES THE SYSTEM COMPLEXITY SUPPORTING
THEM. SO TO ACHIEVE THE RIGHT IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT
OUTCOMES IN PRACTICE, WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT CAN EVOLVE AND SCALE
WITH OUR BUSINESS. AWS IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT WAS
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF MODERN CLOUD
AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION AT A MASSIVE SCALE. IN FACT, AWS
IAM HANDLES 1.2 BILLION API CALLS PER SECOND WORLDWIDE. THAT
MEANS THAT 1.2 BILLION TIMES PER SECOND IAM IS ASKED TO DETERMINE
IF AN API CALL SHOULD BE PERMITTED OR DENIED. IT'S A
LITTLE WILD, RIGHT? BASED ON CUSTOMER FEEDBACK AND TO PROVIDE
YOU WITH THE EXPRESSIVENESS AND FLEXIBILITY YOU NEED, WE BUILT A
SINGLE POWERFUL POLICY LANGUAGE TO POWER IAM. YOU CAN USE IT TO
CONTROL ACCESS TO ALL OF YOUR RESOURCES, WHETHER THAT'S
LAUNCHING AN EC2 INSTANCE, PROVISIONING A DATABASE, OR
WORKING WITH YOUR FAVORITE MODELS IN AMAZON BEDROCK. THIS
POLICY LANGUAGE GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO WRITE TRULY FINE
GRAINED PERMISSIONS FOR YOUR RESOURCES, APPLICATIONS, AND
USERS, AND IT'S EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS TO ADDRESS YOUR PARTICULAR
AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION NEEDS. WHEN CONFIGURING THESE
PERMISSIONS, OUR GOAL IS FOR USERS AND SYSTEMS TO HAVE THE
MINIMUM SET OF PERMISSIONS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THEIR
SPECIFIC JOB FUNCTIONS, AND NOTHING MORE. BY FOLLOWING THIS
PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE, WE CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE
ATTACK SURFACE BY LIMITING THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE FROM A
COMPROMISED ACCOUNT, INSIDER THREAT, OR ACCIDENTAL MISUSE.
IAM HAS THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO HELP YOU ALONG YOUR LEAST
PRIVILEGED JOURNEY. THIS WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE IN THE EARLY
DAYS OF IAM, THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE PERMISSIONS YOU WANTED WAS
TO CONFIGURE THEM UPFRONT. BUT WE QUICKLY REALIZED THAT GETTING
THESE PERMISSIONS RIGHT, IT'S A JOURNEY. IT'S NOT AN UPFRONT
THING. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT LEVEL OF
PERMISSIONS ARE NEEDED UPFRONT. AND FOR MOST ENTERPRISES, WHAT
YOU NEED AND YOUR TOLERANCE FOR RISK. THOSE CHANGE OVER TIME TO.
SO TODAY YOU CAN START WITH A BROADER SET OF PERMISSIONS AND
THEN USE OUR TOOLS TO HELP YOU SET, VERIFY AND REFINE THEM. ONE
OF THESE TOOLS IS IAM ACCESS ANALYZER. ACCESS ANALYZER
PROACTIVELY SCANS RESOURCE POLICIES BEFORE ACCESS IS EVEN
ATTEMPTED BY AN EXTERNAL OR COUNTER USER, FLAGGING POTENTIAL
UNINTENDED EXPOSURE, AND IT ALSO IDENTIFIES IAM ROLES, USERS, AND
PERMISSIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN USED RECENTLY, WHICH HELPS YOU
REMOVE UNNECESSARY ACCESS. FINALLY, IT CAN AUTOMATICALLY
CREATE IAM POLICIES BASED ON WHAT SERVICES AND ACTIONS WERE
ACTUALLY USED ACCORDING TO CLOUDTRAIL LOGS, BUT WE KNEW WE
COULD DO EVEN MORE. SO TODAY, I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THE
GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF AI OF INTERNAL ACCESS FINDINGS, A NEW
IAM ACCESS ANALYZER CAPABILITY. THIS IS PRETTY COOL. POWERED BY
AUTOMATED REASONING, YOU CAN USE INTERNAL ACCESS FINDINGS TO SEE
EXACTLY WHO IN YOUR COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO IMPORTANT AWS
RESOURCES, LIKE AN S3 BUCKET. WITH PCI DATA, WE DO THE HARD
WORK OF ANALYZING THE VARIOUS POLICY TYPES IDENTITY, RESOURCE,
SERVICE, CONTROL POLICIES AND THEN IDENTIFY WHICH IAM ROLES
AND USERS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SPECIFIC RESOURCE. WITH ALL OF
YOUR ACCESS INFORMATION NOW, IN ONE SIMPLE DASHBOARD, YOU CAN
MONITOR BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ACCESS IN ONE VIEW,
MAKING IT MUCH EASIER TO SPOT AND FIX SECURITY ISSUES. AND
FINALLY, THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY CHECKS ACCESS
PERMISSIONS EVERY DAY, AND IT CAN NOTIFY YOU WHEN SOMEONE NEW
GETS ACCESS TO SOMETHING CRITICAL. IAM ACCESS ANALYZER
NOW PROVIDES A HOLISTIC VIEW OF ALL ACCESS GRANTED TO YOUR
CRITICAL ASSETS, GIVING YOU THE FOUNDATION YOU NEED FOR YOUR
RESOURCES. WHILE THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE IS IMPORTANT,
THE NEXT THING WE SHOULD ADDRESS IS THE NEED TO ELIMINATE LONG
TERM CREDENTIALS. LONG TERM CREDS CREATE A PERSISTENT
SECURITY RISK, AND THE LONGER THEY REMAIN VALID, THE LONGER
THREAT ACTORS HAVE TO DISCOVER AND EXPLOIT THEM. CREDENTIAL
ROTATION IS ONE WAY TO LIMIT EXPOSURE, AND IN THE SHORT TERM,
YOU SHOULD FOR SURE AUDIT AND INVENTORY ALL THE CREDS
CURRENTLY IN USE ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION AND ROTATE THEM.
BUT IN THE LONG RUN, YOU SHOULD REPLACE THESE CREDENTIALS BY
LEVERAGING THE RIGHT IAM SERVICES TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY,
LEAST PRIVILEGED ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY RESOURCES. LET'S LOOK
AT A RECENT EXAMPLE WHERE A THREAT ACTOR WAS SUCCESSFUL
USING LONG TERM CREDS TO REALLY SET THE CONTEXT HERE. USING
LEAKED OR STOLEN LONG TERM CREDENTIALS, THEY USED AN
ENCRYPTION METHOD KNOWN AS SERVER SIDE ENCRYPTION USING
CLIENT PROVIDED KEYS TO RE-ENCRYPT OBJECTS WITH A NEW
ENCRYPTION KEY. THIS REPLACED THE CUSTOMER'S ORIGINAL OBJECT
SO CUSTOMERS COULD NO LONGER DECRYPT DATA WITH THEIR OWN
KEYS. NOW, SSE IS A REALLY USEFUL FEATURE FOR ENTERPRISES,
SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE VALID VERSUS
UNAUTHORIZED OPERATIONS THERE. BUT AT AWS, WE PUT OUR ACTIVE
DEFENSE TOOLS TO WORK IN AN EFFORT TO HELP IMPACTED
CUSTOMERS. IN FACT, IN THE FOUR MONTHS BETWEEN DECEMBER 9TH,
2024 TO APRIL 30TH OF THIS YEAR, AWS PREVENTED 943.6 MILLION
ATTEMPTS TO PERFORM UNAUTHORIZED ENCRYPTION OF CUSTOMER S3
OBJECTS. THAT'S ALMOST A BILLION ATTACKS THWARTED. WE LOVE
HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS, BUT IF YOU MOVE AWAY FROM USING FIXED
LONG TERM CREDS, THIS GETS EVEN SIMPLER. TEMPORARY CREDENTIALS
HAVE A LIMITED LIFESPAN THAT YOU CONTROL. ONCE THOSE CREDENTIALS
EXPIRE, THEY CAN'T BE REUSED. IAM AND IAM IDENTITY CENTER COME
WITH COMPREHENSIVE IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES
TO HELP YOU MOVE AWAY FROM LONG TERM CREDENTIALS. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU CAN USE IAM INSTANCE PROFILES FOR YOUR COMPUTE WHERE
YOU JUST DEFINE NECESSARY PERMISSIONS, AND WE DO
EVERYTHING ELSE WITH IDENTITY FEDERATION. YOUR USERS GET
SEAMLESS SIGN ON. AND I SHOULD MENTION IAM ROLES WHICH HAVE
BEEN TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR SECURITY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE
TEMPORARY CREDENTIALS THAT DON'T NEED TO BE ROTATED. AND FOR
HYBRID AND MULTI-CLOUD WORKLOADS, YOU CAN USE IAM ROLES
ANYWHERE TO SEAMLESSLY AUTHENTICATE AND ACCESS YOUR AWS
RESOURCES. WE ARE CONTINUALLY LOOKING FOR MORE WAYS TO MAKE IT
EASIER FOR YOU TO RAISE THE SECURITY BAR. IN ADDITION TO
CREDENTIALS WITH LONG LIFETIMES, THOSE WITH ELEVATED PERMISSIONS
CAN INCREASE YOUR RISK. SO AT LAST YEAR'S RE:INVENT, WE
ANNOUNCED NEW FEATURES TO HELP YOU ELIMINATE THE USE OF
OVERPRIVILEGED ROOT CREDENTIALS AND PROVISION SECURE BY DEFAULT
MEMBER ACCOUNTS WITH THE CENTRALLY MANAGED ROOT ACCESS
AND ROOT SESSION FEATURES IN IAM, YOU CAN REMOVE UNNECESSARY
ROOT CREDENTIALS AND ISSUE TEMPORARY ELEVATED PERMISSIONS
TO MANAGE YOUR AWS ACCOUNT JUST WHEN IT'S NEEDED. AND FOR THOSE
SCENARIOS THAT YOU STILL NEED AN IAM USER OR ROOT USER IN YOUR
ACCOUNT, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS ENFORCE MULTI-FACTOR
AUTHENTICATION. MFA IS THE SINGLE BEST SECURITY PRACTICE
YOU CAN IMPLEMENT TO PROTECT YOUR ACCOUNTS FROM UNAUTHORIZED
ACCESS. PERIOD. WE WERE THE FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO MANDATE
THE USE OF MFA FOR MANAGEMENT AND STANDALONE ACCOUNTS WITH
ROOT ACCESS. WE'VE ALSO MADE IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO USE
STRONG MFA BY LAUNCHING SUPPORT FOR FIDO2 PASSKEYS. AND I SHOULD
MENTION THAT WE SUPPORT UP TO EIGHT MFA DEVICES PER ROOT OR
IAM USER TO HELP CUSTOMERS AVOID PROBLEMS WITH LOST TOKENS. TO
FURTHER SUPPORT THE CISO SECURE BY DESIGN PLEDGE THIS MARCH, WE
EXPANDED OUR POLICY TO ENFORCE MFA FOR MEMBER ACCOUNT ROOT
USERS. THOSE NON-MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION.
AND WITH THIS STEP, I'M SO HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE NOW HAVE 100% MFA
ENFORCEMENT FOR ROOT USERS ACROSS ALL TYPES OF AWS
ACCOUNTS. YEAH, THAT'S WORTH APPLAUSE LIKE. WELL, IDENTITY
AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT CONTROLS WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR RESOURCES.
SECURING THE DATA ITSELF REQUIRES ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF
PROTECTION AND CONTROL. IN A WORLD WITH EVER CHANGING
DYNAMICS AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING POLICIES, CONTROL OVER WHERE
DATA IS LOCATED HAS BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. AND AT THE SAME
TIME, DATA FUELS INNOVATION. WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
CHOOSE BETWEEN DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY AND INNOVATION.
SOVEREIGNTY HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR AWS SINCE THE VERY
BEGINNING, WHEN WE WERE THE ONLY LEADING CLOUD PROVIDER TO ALLOW
CUSTOMERS TO CONTROL THE LOCATION AND MOVEMENT OF THEIR
DATA. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE OFFERING ALL AWS
CUSTOMERS THE MOST ADVANCED SET OF SOVEREIGNTY CONTROLS AND
FEATURES AVAILABLE IN THE CLOUD. THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING CONTROL
OVER THE LOCATION OF YOUR DATA, VERIFIABLE CONTROL OVER WHO CAN
ACCESS YOUR DATA. SOVEREIGN AND RESILIENT OPTIONS THAT ALLOW YOU
TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS THROUGH DISRUPTION OR DISCONNECTION, AND
THE ABILITY TO ENCRYPT EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE.
ENCRYPTION USED TO BE TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE, WHICH
OFTEN MEANT THAT IT WOULD ONLY BE USED FOR YOUR MOST SENSITIVE
DATA. ON AWS, ENCRYPTION IS ESSENTIALLY FREE, BOTH IN COST
AND IN ENGINEERING EFFORT, WHICH IS SOMETIMES AS IMPORTANT,
ENABLING YOU TO ENCRYPT EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE. AND
DEFENSE IN DEPTH IS IMPORTANT. HERE. INFORMATION IS
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO INTERCEPTION AND THEFT WHEN
MOVING ACROSS NETWORKS, WHETHER THAT'S BETWEEN INTERNAL SYSTEMS
OR OVER THE INTERNET TO AN EXTERNAL DESTINATION. IF WE
THINK ABOUT THE OSI LAYER MODEL, WHICH IS A GREAT ABSTRACTION FOR
THE PROTOCOLS AND LAYERS THAT MUST INTEROPERATE TO POWER THE
NETWORK, YOU CAN SEE HOW AWS HAS YOUR BACK AND SIMPLIFIES HOLDING
A STRONGER SECURITY BAR. ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, IT BECAME
INCREASINGLY COMMON TO ENCRYPT TRAFFIC OVER PROTOCOLS LIKE SSL
AND TLS, WHICH IS GREAT. THIS INSERTS A NEW KIND OF INVISIBLE
TRANSPORT ENCRYPTION LAYER. AT AWS. WE TAKE OUR CUSTOMER
PROMISES VERY SERIOUSLY, AND SO WE'RE UNWILLING TO RELY ON A
SINGLE LAYER OF PROTECTION. WE WANT TO GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED, EVEN IF THERE'S AN
ISSUE WITHIN ONE SYSTEM. IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT REAL TRAFFIC IN
THE AWS NETWORK, YOU WOULD SEE THAT WE HAVE A LAYER THAT
PERVASIVELY ENCRYPTS THE PHYSICAL NETWORK LINK, AND
TRAFFIC IN OUR VPC IS TRANSPARENTLY ENCRYPTED WITH
PACKETS WRAPPED IN AN AWS SPECIFIC HEADER. IT ISN'T
UNUSUAL FOR CUSTOMER TRAFFIC TO BE ENCRYPTED THREE OR EVEN MORE
TIMES WHEN IT'S MOVING THROUGH THE NETWORK, SOMETHING WE ARE
ABLE TO DO AT SCALE WHILE DELIVERING EXTREMELY HIGH
NETWORK PERFORMANCE. THIS IS SIMPLE INCREASED PROTECTION FOR
YOU AND YOUR DATA. NOW LET'S ZOOM TO THAT TRANSPORT LAYER AND
TALK ABOUT DIGITAL CERTIFICATES. I'M A MATH NERD, SO THIS IS MY
FAVORITE PART. WE KNOW THAT MANAGEMENT OF DIGITAL
CERTIFICATES IS A CHALLENGE FOR MAINTAINING VISIBILITY AND
CONTROL ACROSS DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS TO MANAGING LIFE
CYCLES, RENEWALS, KEY STORAGE, COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS. ALL OF
THAT BECOMES EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AT SCALE. AWS
CERTIFICATE MANAGER SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESS OF PROVISIONING,
MANAGING AND DEPLOYING PUBLIC CERTS. SINCE LAUNCHING IN 2016,
ACM HAS HELPED ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE GLOBE ELIMINATE THE
TIME CONSUMING PROCESS OF MANAGING TLS CERTIFICATES. I
WISH IT WERE AROUND EARLIER IN MY CAREER. IT'S FABULOUS. FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU'RE SECURING COMMUNICATION TO A WEB
APPLICATION, YOU CAN REQUEST A PUBLIC CERTIFICATE FROM ACM AND
ASSOCIATED IT WITH AN APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER THAT'S
MANAGING TRAFFIC TO YOUR APPLICATION SERVERS THAT ARE
RUNNING ON EC2. YOU CAN DO THE SAME FOR THE CLOUDFRONT
DISTRIBUTION THAT'S HOSTING YOUR CONTENT AT AN EDGE LOCATION, BUT
YOU CAN'T USE ACM PUBLIC CERTIFICATES TO CONNECT TO AN ON
PREMISE RESOURCE OR A THIRD PARTY SERVICE. UNTIL NOW, I AM
THRILLED TO SHARE THAT STARTING TODAY, YOU CAN EXPORT ACM ISSUED
PUBLIC CERTS AND THEIR PRIVATE KEYS FOR USE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
OF AWS, I KNOW. WHEN YOU REQUEST A PUBLIC CERTIFICATE THROUGH
ACM, YOU NOW HAVE THE OPTION TO DESIGNATE IT AS EXPORTABLE AND
ONCE THAT CERTIFICATE IS ISSUED, YOU CAN EXPORT AND DOWNLOAD THE
CERTIFICATE, PRIVATE KEY AND CERTIFICATE CHAIN TO USE IT
WHEREVER YOU WANT. YOU GET THE VALUE OF CENTRAL CERTIFICATE
MANAGEMENT, MANAGED RENEWALS, AUTOMATION, AUTOMATIC ROTATION,
NOTIFICATIONS ALL AT A LOWER PRICE THAN OTHER COMMERCIAL
CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES. IT'S SIMPLE. WHILE PROTECTING DATA AS
IT MOVES BETWEEN POINTS IS CRUCIAL, IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO
SAFEGUARD INFORMATION AND APPLICATIONS FROM CYBER THREATS.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT NETWORK PROTECTION. FOR YEARS, AWS
SHIELD HAS BEEN YOUR TRUSTED DEFENSE AGAINST DDOS EVENTS,
AUTOMATICALLY DEFENDING YOUR APPLICATIONS FROM THREATS THAT
COULD IMPACT YOUR AVAILABILITY. BUT BETWEEN A RAPIDLY EVOLVING
LANDSCAPE AND YOUR OWN GROWTH AND SCALE, WE KNOW THAT
IDENTIFYING RESOURCES, CONNECTIONS, AND CONFIGURATIONS
THAT REQUIRE PROTECTION CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND COMPLICATED.
MOREOVER, HAVING TO RELY ON MULTIPLE TOOLS TO ANALYZE AND
DETERMINE THE PRIORITY OF SECURITY ISSUES CAN BE
OPERATIONALLY INTENSIVE, AND YOU NEED CONFIDENCE THAT YOUR
PROTECTION KEEPS PACE WITH ALL OF THESE CHANGES. TODAY, I'M
EXCITED TO SHARE THAT WE'RE EXPANDING THE CAPABILITIES OF
AWS SHIELD WITH THE PREVIEW OF NETWORK SECURITY DIRECTOR. THIS
PROVIDES PROTECTION THAT SPANS FROM DDOS DEFENSE TO
COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK SECURITY MANAGEMENT. WITH THIS UPDATE,
YOU CAN MORE EASILY IDENTIFY NETWORK SECURITY, CONFIGURATION
ISSUES, NETWORK SECURITY DIRECTOR STARTS BY PERFORMING AN
ANALYSIS OF YOUR NETWORK, BUILDING A TOPOLOGY BASED ON THE
RESOURCES, CONNECTIONS, NETWORK SECURITY SERVICES, AND RULE SETS
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IT THEN ASSESSES THE NETWORK
SECURITY CONFIGURATION OF YOUR RESOURCES AND WHETHER THEY MEET
AWS NETWORK SECURITY BEST PRACTICES. SO INSTEAD OF WAITING
THROUGH ALERTS TO DETERMINE WHICH ISSUES TO TACKLE FIRST, WE
AGGREGATE THE FINDINGS BY SEVERITY WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR
ENABLING THE RECOMMENDED SERVICES OR RULE SETS. IT'S KIND
OF LIKE HAVING A TEAM OF AWS SECURITY EXPERTS MONITORING YOUR
NETWORK ARCHITECTURE AND GIVING YOU THE BOTTOM LINE SIMPLY, WHEN
SHIELD DEFENDS AGAINST LARGE SCALE EVENTS THAT ARE TRYING TO
OVERWHELM YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, AWS WEB APPLICATION FIREWALL
SIMULTANEOUSLY BLOCKS ATTEMPTS TO EXPLOIT YOUR APPLICATIONS.
WAF ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE PRECISE SECURITY RULES THAT FILTER OUT
MALICIOUS TRAFFIC. YOU CAN BLOCK COMMON EVENTS LIKE SQL INJECTION
OR CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING, PREVENT ACCESS FROM SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC
LOCATIONS, OR STOP SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS. HOWEVER, CONFIGURING
WEB APPLICATION SECURITY CAN BE TIME CONSUMING. IT'S A PROCESS
THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE CONSOLE PAGES AND COMPLEX RULE
SELECTION. AND AGAIN, WE THINK YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION AND EASE OF USE, WHICH IS WHY
I'M EXCITED TO INTRODUCE A SIMPLIFIED CONSOLE EXPERIENCE
FOR AWS WAF, WHICH TRANSFORMS THE WEB APPLICATION AND API
SECURITY SETUP PROCESS INTO ONE ONBOARDING WIZARD. THIS IS A
FUNDAMENTAL REIMAGINING OF HOW ORGANIZATIONS MANAGE APPLICATION
SECURITY. IT EXCUSE ME, IT REDUCES THE STEPS REQUIRED TO
CONFIGURE INITIAL APPLICATION SECURITY BY 80%, AND THIS
ENABLES SECURITY TEAMS TO PROTECT THEIR APPLICATIONS IN
MINUTES INSTEAD OF HOURS. WE'RE INTRODUCING WORKLOAD SPECIFIC
RULE PACKS THAT PROVIDE PRECONFIGURED PROTECTION FOR
COMMON WORKLOAD TYPES, WHETHER THAT'S APIS OR PHP APPLICATIONS,
MAKING IT EASIER TO GET STARTED WITH FOUNDATIONAL PROTECTION.
THESE EXPERT CURATED RULE PACKS INCORPORATE OUR YEARS OF
EXPERIENCE AND WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED TO ADDRESS
NEW THREATS. THROUGH A NEW UNIFIED DASHBOARD, YOU CAN
ACCESS CONSOLIDATED SECURITY METRICS HERE. YOU CAN TUNE
EXISTING RULES BY MONITORING FOR FALSE POSITIVES OR RESPOND TO
POTENTIAL THREATS, ALL FROM WITHIN THIS DASHBOARD. SECURITY
CONTROLS LIKE RATE LIMITING, GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS, AND IP
REPUTATION FILTERING CAN ALSO BE CUSTOMIZED WITHIN THE DASHBOARD,
BUT WE KNOW IT ISN'T ALWAYS THE SECURITY TEAM SETTING UP THE WEB
APPLICATION FIREWALL. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU'RE A DEVELOPER
WANTING TO LEVERAGE CLOUDFRONT FOR CONTENT DELIVERY, YOU HAVE
TO CONFIGURE THE CLOUDFRONT DISTRIBUTION, MANAGE DNS
SETTINGS, AND ROUTE 53 CONFIGURE APPROPRIATE SECURITY CONTROLS IN
WAF, AND ASSOCIATE A TLS CERTIFICATE THROUGH ACM. YOU
MIGHT NOT BE AN EXPERT IN MANY OF THOSE TASKS. WE WANTED TO
MAKE THIS PROCESS EASIER TO ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO TAKE
OWNERSHIP OF THAT SECURITY BAR. I'M EXCITED TO INTRODUCE A
SIMPLIFIED ONBOARDING EXPERIENCE FOR AMAZON CLOUDFRONT, ENABLING
DEVELOPERS TO ACHIEVE FAST, SECURE CONTENT DELIVERY WITHOUT
REQUIRING DEEP TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. THE CLOUDFRONT
CONSOLE PROVIDES AN INTELLIGENT, CENTRALIZED EXPERIENCE THAT
STREAMLINES SERVICE CONFIGURATION AND MANAGEMENT. IN
ADDITION TO MANAGING CDN SETTINGS, YOU CAN NOW MANAGE
SETTINGS FOR WAF, ROUTE 53, AND CERTIFICATE MANAGER FROM WITHIN
THE CLOUDFRONT CONSOLE. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS DEVELOPERS,
REGARDLESS OF THEIR PRIOR EXPERIENCE, TO MORE EASILY
CONFIGURE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT DELIVERS CONTENT
QUICKLY, SECURELY, AND RELIABLY TO THEIR USERS. EVEN WITH THE
LEVELS OF PROTECTION THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED, IT CAN STILL BE
DIFFICULT TO DEFEND AGAINST EMERGING THREATS. THE WORLD IS
CHANGING PRETTY QUICKLY. CUSTOMERS ARE FACING AN INCREASE
IN ACTIVE THREAT TYPES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO INDEPENDENTLY
DETECT AND DEFEND AGAINST. AT AWS, WE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN
THE DEFENSE OF YOU, OUR CUSTOMERS, IN WAYS YOU MIGHT NOT
REALIZE. FOR EXAMPLE, BY BRINGING YOU BEHIND THE SCENES A
LITTLE BIT, SITTING AT THE EDGE OF OUR NETWORK IS AN INTERNAL
NETWORK MAPPING DEVICE CALLED BLACKFOOT. ONE OF THE THINGS
I'VE LOVED ABOUT THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS IS LEARNING SOME OF THE
STORIES BEHIND THE NAMES, SO IF I CAN DIVERT US FOR A SECOND,
THE BLACKFOOT CODE NAME IS ACTUALLY A NOD TO THE LINUX
MASCOT, TUX THE PENGUIN, AND THE BLACK FOOTED PENGUINS THAT ARE
LOCAL TO CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA, WHERE EC2 WAS DEVELOPED.
ISN'T THAT COOL? WHEN ANY PACKET COMES INTO THE AWS NETWORK,
BLACKFOOT TRANSLATES THE OUTSIDE IP ADDRESS TO THE INSIDE IP
ADDRESS, AND THIS HAPPENS FOR ALL TRAFFIC GOING IN AND OUT OF
EVERY VPC ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE SCALE,
THAT MEANS BLACKFOOT HANDLES TRANSLATING OVER 13 TRILLION
FLOWS PER HOUR. YOU NEVER GET USED TO THE BIG NUMBERS HERE.
I'LL JUST SAY IT NOW. WE'VE ALSO USED EC2 TO BUILD AN INTERNAL
SERVICE THAT WE CALL MAD POD. MAD POD IS A COLLECTION OF EC2
INSTANCES WITH HIGH INTERACTION HONEYPOTS. THESE HONEYPOTS
ADVERTISE DIFFERENT SERVICES WHILE PRETENDING TO BE
VULNERABLE VERSIONS OF THOSE SERVICES, AND THE GOAL IS TO
ATTRACT BAD ACTORS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF MAD PODS RUNNING IN OUR GLOBAL NETWORK, AND THEY'RE
CONSTANTLY SHIFTING THROUGH OUR IP SPACE. SO WHILE MAD POD GIVES
US INTEL TO IDENTIFY THE BAD ACTORS, BLACKFOOT GIVES US THE
DATA PLANE TO STOP THEIR ACTIVITIES. USING BLACKFOOT AND
MAD POT, WE'VE IMPLEMENTED CUSTOM PACKET PROCESSING AT A
MASSIVE SCALE. WE CAN DETECT BAD ACTORS SCANNING FOR
VULNERABILITIES AND PLACE THEIR IPS IN A DROP TABLE SO THAT ANY
PACKET THEY SEND NEVER EVEN SEES YOUR VPC. THIS PROTECTION IS
AVAILABLE IN EVERY INTERNET CONNECTED REGION AND PROVIDES
PROTECTION FOR EVERY AWS CUSTOMER AT NO COST TO YOU. IT'S
REDUCED THE NUMBER OF VULNERABILITY PROBING ATTEMPTS
BY MORE THAN 75%, PREVENTING 2.4 TRILLION MALICIOUS SCANNING
REQUESTS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS ALONE. WE ALSO MEASURE
THE LIST OF MITIGATED IP ADDRESSES EVERY THREE MINUTES,
AND ON AVERAGE, 12.5% OF THOSE IPS MITIGATED BY BLACKFOOT
CHANGE IN THAT THREE MINUTE WINDOW. THIS MEANS THE TIME
VALUE OF THREAT INTELLIGENCE IS INCREDIBLY SHORT. A DAILY OR
EVEN HOURLY FEED TO SLOW. THAT'S WHY WE ARE ALSO BUILDING ACTIVE
DEFENSE MEASURES INTO OUR SERVICES. I'M HAPPY TO INTRODUCE
AWS NETWORK FIREWALL, ENHANCED WITH ACTIVE THREAT DEFENSE,
OFFERING PROTECTION AGAINST EMERGING AND ACTIVELY EXPLOITED
THREATS. IT LEVERAGES THREAT INTELLIGENCE GAINED FROM THE AWS
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO RAPIDLY IDENTIFY THREATS, AND THEN
AUTOMATICALLY APPLIES AWS MANAGED RULES TO BLOCK EVASIVE
COMMAND AND CONTROL CHANNELS, MALICIOUS URLS, AND OTHER
EXPLOITS. AWS NETWORK FIREWALL WITH ACTIVE THREAT DEFENSE
STRENGTHENS YOUR SECURITY WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL
COMPLEXITY OR OPERATIONAL OVERHEAD. TO HELP SIMPLIFY
SECURITY AT SCALE, WE'VE INTEGRATED PROTECTION MECHANISMS
INTO AWS SERVICES SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM
PIECE BY PIECE. THIS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH HELPS YOU
SCALE WITH CONFIDENCE. I'D LIKE TO INVITE NOOPUR DAVIS, GLOBAL
CISO AT COMCAST, TO SHARE HOW COMCAST HAS BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE
THEIR SECURITY POSTURE WITH AWS. NOOPUR, OVER TO YOU.
[MUSIC] >> THANK YOU AMY. GOOD MORNING
EVERYONE. WELCOME TO PHILLY. PHILLY HAPPENS TO BE THE
HEADQUARTERS OF COMCAST. AND AS YOU CAN SEE COMCAST IS BIG. AND
THE QUESTION YOU MAY ASK IS HOW DO YOU SECURE A BUSINESS OF THIS
SCALE, THIS COMPLEXITY AND THIS DIVERSITY OF BUSINESSES. AND WE
THINK THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A WELL-DEFINED
MISSION. THE MISSION FOR COMCAST CYBER SECURITY IS WE PROTECT THE
INCREDIBLE TECHNOLOGY AND PLATFORMS THAT CONNECT MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE TO THE MOMENTS THAT MATTER. THIS IS A REALLY
PURPOSEFUL MISSION FOR OUR 2000 PLUS CYBERSECURITY
PROFESSIONALS. THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE IS NOT JUST MISSION
DRIVEN, THEY ARE EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE. LAST YEAR, MORE THAN
10% OF ALL PATENTS GRANTED AT COMCAST WERE GRANTED TO COMCAST
CYBERSECURITY TEAM. I AM SO PROUD OF THAT. THANK YOU. THAT'S
APPLAUSE FOR MY TEAM. YAY! SO WE ALSO TAKE A VERY LONG TERM VIEW
OF SECURITY. AND FOR THAT WE HAVE DEFINED THREE NORTH STARS.
OUR FIRST NORTH STAR IS BUILD SECURITY AND PRIVACY INTO ALL OF
OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS IS WHAT AMY JUST TALKED ABOUT
WHEN SHE REFERRED TO SECURE BY DESIGN. IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS
SHIFTLEFT. OUR SECOND NORTH STAR IS THAT WE USE DATA TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE ARE IMPROVING THE SECURITY EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR
SOLUTIONS. AND OUR THIRD NORTH STAR IS THAT WE OPERATE ON ZERO
TRUST PRINCIPLES. NOW, THESE HAVE BEEN OUR NORTH STARS FOR
SEVEN YEARS. WE REALLY DO TAKE A LONG TERM VIEW OF SECURITY, AND
SOMETIMES WE MAKE REVOLUTIONARY PROGRESS, BUT USUALLY IT'S
EVOLUTIONARY SLOW, STEADY PROGRESS ALONG THOSE THREE NORTH
STARS. NOW, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SLIDE. YOU
CAN'T DO A PRESENTATION THESE DAYS WITHOUT THE WORD AI. SO, AS
YOU ALL KNOW, IN 2023 GENERATIVE AI BECAME PART OF OUR COLLECTIVE
CONSCIOUSNESS. AND PEOPLE AT COMCAST, INCLUDING THE CYBER
TEAM, WERE SO EXCITED. I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW, NEW WAYS OF DOING
THINGS, NEW TOOLS AND METHODS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. SO WE STARTED
THINKING, OKAY, HOW DOES CYBER ADAPT TO THIS? AND I WILL TALK
OUR FRAMEWORK OF OUR THREE NORTH STARS. SO WE WERE ALREADY DOING
THINGS LIKE THREAT MODELING PENTESTING. WE WERE FINDING AND
FIXING CODE VULNERABILITIES. WE STARTED TO NOW ADAPT THESE
PROCESSES. YOU KNOW, WE LOOKED AT THE OWASP LLM TOP TEN. WE
LOOKED AT THE MITRE ATLAS GUIDELINES. WE DID OUR OWN
RESEARCH. WE LEARNED FROM OUR PEERS. AND SO TODAY, THREAT
MODELS NOW INCORPORATE THINGS LIKE DO WE KNOW THE PROVENANCE
OF NOT JUST THE TRAINING DATA, BUT THE MODEL FOR PROMPTS? DO WE
KNOW DO WE HAVE THINGS LIKE GUARDRAILS? ARE WE LOOKING FOR
HALLUCINATIONS? ARE WE DOING INPUT VALIDATION? ARE WE LOOKING
FOR DATA EXFILTRATION? AND WE'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT.
WHAT IS SURPRISING TO ME IS THAT IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, ONE OUT
OF EVERY FIVE. SO THAT'S 20% OF THREAT MODEL AND PENTESTING
FINDINGS AT COMCAST TODAY RESULT FROM OUR DEVELOPERS BUILDING AI
SOLUTIONS. THAT'S AN AMAZING TRANSFORMATION. IN LESS THAN TWO
YEARS. NOW AS WE'RE DOING THIS, OUR CTO'S OFFICE IS BUILDING
TOOLS AND PLATFORMS FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT TEAMS. SO WE ARE
CREATING AN AI. BENCHMARK. SORRY, I LOST THE WORD FOR A
MINUTE. AI WORKBENCH SORRY ABOUT THAT. AND ALSO MATURING OUR AI
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE. SO AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THAT WE
BUILT A TOOL WHERE YOU CAN DO A PROMPT OR A NATURAL LANGUAGE
INPUT, AND THE OUTCOME IS USER STORIES FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT
TEAMS. WELL, PART OF THAT PROCESS NOW INCLUDES GENERATION
OF SECURITY USER STORIES. SO THAT IS HOW WE'RE INTEGRATING
NOW. WE'RE ALSO USING AI TO IMPROVE SOME OF THESE PROCESSES.
FOR EXAMPLE FOR THREAT MODELS, WE USED TO REQUIRE AN
ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM OF SOME TYPE. TODAY WE'VE BUILT TOOLING
THAT GOES DIRECTLY ONTO DEVELOPER WIKIS OR DEVELOPER
DOCUMENTATION. AND IT EXTRACTS ALL OF THE RELEVANT INFORMATION,
SUMMARIZES IT. AND NOW YOU CAN DO THREAT MODELS MUCH FASTER
THAN BEFORE. SAME FOR PENTESTS. YOU KNOW, PENTESTS TAKE A LOT OF
PREPARATION AND THEN A QA AND THEN THE REPORTING. ALL OF THAT
IS RIGHT FOR GEN AI LEAVING PEN TESTERS TO DO WHAT THEY LIKE TO
DO BEST, WHICH IS TO PEN TEST ON THE SECOND NORTH STAR. WE REALLY
GOT LUCKY BECAUSE WHEN GEN AI BURST ONTO THE SCENE, WE ALREADY
HAD A VERY MATURE SECURITY DATA LAKE. WE HAD TEN PETABYTES OF
DATA, TWO YEARS OF HISTORY. ABOUT 100 DATA SOURCES ALREADY
NORMALIZED, ALREADY CORRELATED. AND AS WE STARTED TO LOOK AT
WHAT GEN AI WAS BRINGING TO THE TABLE, IT WAS LIKE PARTY TIME.
EVERYBODY WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW CAPABILITIES THAT OUR
DATA WAS ABOUT TO UNLEASH. SO TODAY, OUR NETWORK RELIABILITY
ENGINEERING TEAM USES OUR DATA SECURITY DATA. OUR ASSET
MANAGEMENT TEAM USES OUR DATA TO IDENTIFY LIKELY OWNERS OF ASSETS
WITHOUT OWNERS. WE ALSO HAVE A CHATBOT THAT REACHES OUT TO THE
OWNER AND MAKES SURE THEY CLAIM OWNERSHIP. REMEMBER THAT 100
DATA SOURCES I JUST TALKED ABOUT? WELL, MAINTAINING THOSE
DATA PIPELINES WAS BECOMING TREMENDOUSLY RESOURCE INTENSIVE.
SO WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SIX STAGE GEN AI PIPELINE THAT DOES
EVERYTHING FROM LOOK AT THE CONTENT AND SHAPE OF THE DATA
COMING IN TO GENERATING THE CODE THAT GENERATES THE SCHEMAS, AND
THEN POPULATES THE SCHEMAS SO THAT ENTIRE PROCESS IS NOW
AUTOMATED, FREEING UP A TON OF RESOURCES. AND I CAN'T LEAVE
THIS SLIDE WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT GRC GOVERNANCE, RISK AND
COMPLIANCE. WE ARE FINDING THAT THIS IS THE MOST RIPEST GROUND
FOR USE OF GEN AI. SO WE HAVE SO MANY BOTS THERE TODAY ALREADY.
WE HAVE AN AI BOT THAT TALKS TO OUR CONTINUOUS CONTROLS
COMPLIANCE SYSTEM. WE HAVE BOTS THAT LOOK AT SOC2 ATTESTATIONS.
WE HAVE BOTS THAT GENERATE FILL OUT VENDOR QUESTIONNAIRES. IT'S
JUST REALLY ALMOST EVERY FEW WEEKS THERE'S A NEW USE CASE
THAT EMERGES. AND THEN FINALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT OUR THIRD NORTH
STAR, YOU KNOW, IDENTITY AND SEGMENTATION ARE CORNER STORES
FOR CORNERSTONES FOR ZERO TRUST. SO WE HAVE BUILT SOMETHING WE
CALLED ONE RISK ENGINE THAT LOOKS AT EVERY USER
AUTHENTICATION AT COMCAST. AND IT RISK RANKS IT. AND WE DO THIS
WITH ALL OF THE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE ABOUT
OUR COMPANY, OUR PEOPLE AND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND AGAIN FROM
MICRO-SEGMENTATION, WE REALLY, REALLY RELY ON THINGS LIKE AWS
SECURITY GROUPS. WE HAVE BUILT OUR OWN MICRO-SEGMENTATION
PLATFORM AND AI IS REALLY HELPING THERE AS WELL, BECAUSE
ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WITH MICRO-SEGMENTATION IS TO FIGURE
OUT WHO YOUR TENANTS ARE TALKING TO AND WHO YOUR WHO IS TALKING
TO YOUR TENANTS. THAT'S WHERE I REALLY HELPS US. NOW, ALL OF
THIS IS REALLY GREAT. YOU KNOW, HAVING NORTH STARS IN A MISSION
AND AN AWESOME TEAM. BUT WE ALSO NEED GOVERNANCE AND CONTROLS.
AND FOR THAT WE HAVE CONTINUOUS CONTROLS MONITORING. WE REALLY
FOCUS ON SECURITY, HYGIENE. YOU KNOW, THAT GRUNT WORK THAT
NOBODY WANTS TO DO BUT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SECURITY. WE FOCUS
ON OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE. AND THEN FINALLY OUR STRATEGIC
PARTNERSHIPS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO US. AND THIS IS WHERE OUR SIX
YEAR OLD PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS IS SO, SO VALUABLE. THESE ARE JUST
SOME OF THE AWS CAPABILITIES THAT MY CYBER TEAM USES AT
COMCAST. SO THANK YOU AWS. AND WITH THAT I'M GOING TO CLOSE
THANKING YOU. WISHING YOU A WONDERFUL REST OF THE DAY AND AN
AWESOME REST OF THE CONFERENCE. THANK YOU.
>> THANKS, NOOPUR. IT'S AMAZING TO SEE HOW COMCAST IS LEVERAGING
AWS TO IMPROVE THEIR SECURITY POSTURE. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE
FROM AI AND TALK ABOUT MONITORING. EFFECTIVE MONITORING
IS SO CRITICAL FOR SECURITY, BUT IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO KNOW
WHAT TO MONITOR AND HOW TO DO IT EFFECTIVELY. THE CORE CHALLENGE
IS THAT SECURITY MONITORING NATURALLY GRAVITATES TOWARD
DETECTING WHAT IT'S EASY TO IDENTIFY, RATHER THAN
NECESSARILY WHAT'S MOST DANGEROUS. THE ACTIVITIES THAT
GENERATE CLEAR, UNAMBIGUOUS ALERTS TEND TO GET THE MOST
ATTENTION, WHILE THE SUBTLE BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES AND LOW AND
SLOW ATTACKS THAT CHARACTERIZE ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT MIGHT
REMAIN UNDETECTED. THIS IS THE STREETLIGHT EFFECT APPLIED TO
CYBERSECURITY. JUST LIKE SOMEONE SEARCHES FOR THEIR LOST KEYS
UNDER THE STREETLIGHT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE LIGHT IS
BRIGHTEST AND IT'S EASIEST TO SEE THEM. SECURITY TEAMS MIGHT
FOCUS ON THE TYPES OF MALICIOUS ACTIVITY THAT ARE EASIEST TO
DETECT AND INVESTIGATE, NOT BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE
GREATEST THREATS, NECESSARILY, BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE MOST
VISIBLE UNDER THE GLOW OF OUR EXISTING MONITORING
CAPABILITIES. AND WE WONDERED, HOW COULD WE MAKE THIS SIMPLER
FOR YOU? IT STARTS WITH THE FACT THAT SINCE DAY ONE, WE DESIGNED
EVERY AWS SERVICE AS AN API. OUR APIS ARE USED BY EVERY CUSTOMER
TO PROGRAMMATICALLY MANAGE THEIR AWS RESOURCES, WHETHER THAT'S
SPINNING UP A LOAD BALANCER OR ROUTING SYSTEM OR A COMPUTE
INSTANCE. EVERY API CALL LEAVES A TRACE. TO GIVE YOU SOME MORE
CONTEXT, AT AWS, EVERY DAY WE INSPECT OVER 360 TRILLION
TELEMETRY EVENTS ON AVERAGE FOR SIGNS OF RECONNAISSANCE,
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, LATERAL MOVEMENT, OR OTHER ATTACKER
TECHNIQUES. WE'VE ALSO DEVELOPED THE TOOLS THAT HELP YOU ADDRESS
SECURITY AND MONITORING CHALLENGES. YOU CAN USE AMAZON
CLOUDWATCH AND AWS CLOUDTRAIL TO GET INSIGHTS INTO RESOURCE
SECURITY AND API USAGE. WHILE AMAZON SECURITY LAKE ACTS AS AN
AGGREGATOR THAT NORMALIZES AND COMBINES SECURITY DATA, USING
OCSF TO BRIDGE THE GAPS BETWEEN TOOLS AND ACCELERATE THREAT
DETECTION. WE'VE ALSO BUILT SERVICES LIKE GUARDDUTY THAT'S
PACKED WITH INNOVATIVE SCIENCE AND USES PROPRIETARY THREAT
INTEL TO HELP YOU ANALYZE VPC FLOW LOGS AND CLOUDTRAIL EVENTS
TO IDENTIFY THREATS. GUARDDUTY USES MACHINE LEARNING AND AI TO
HELP MINIMIZE FALSE POSITIVES, MAKING IT EASIER TO BUILD
RELIABLE AUTOMATIONS FOR YOUR SECURITY PRACTICE. AND WE
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ENHANCING THESE CAPABILITIES TO BETTER
SERVE YOU. FOR EXAMPLE, IN DECEMBER, WE ANNOUNCED THE
GENERAL AVAILABILITY OF GUARDDUTY EXTENDED THREAT
DETECTION, WHICH USES AI AND MACHINE LEARNING TO
AUTOMATICALLY CORRELATE SECURITY SIGNALS FROM ACROSS AWS SERVICES
TO DETECT CRITICAL THREATS. THIS CAPABILITY ALLOWS FOR THE
IDENTIFICATION OF ATTACK SEQUENCES LIKE CREDENTIAL
COMPROMISE FOLLOWED BY DATA EXFILTRATION, AND THEN IT
AGGREGATES THEM INTO A SINGLE CRITICAL SEVERITY FINDING FOR
YOU. THIS FINDING INCLUDES AN INCIDENT SUMMARY, A DETAILED
EVENTS TIMELINE THAT MAPS TO MITRE ATTACK TACTICS AND
TECHNIQUES, AND REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS. EXTENDED THREAT
DETECTION HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. IN A 90 DAY PERIOD,
GUARDDUTY EXTENDED THREAT DETECTION IDENTIFIED OVER 13,000
HIGH CONFIDENCE ATTACK SEQUENCES AMONG MILLIONS OF MONITORED AWS
ACCOUNTS IN THE US. THIS TRANSLATES TO AN AVERAGE OF LESS
THAN TWO HIGH CONFIDENCE ATTACK SEQUENCES PER AFFECTED ACCOUNT,
DEMONSTRATING OUR ABILITY TO SURFACE ONLY THE MOST CRITICAL
SECURITY EVENTS. WHEN YOU SEE THIS, YOU DO SOMETHING. BUILDING
ON DECEMBER'S LAUNCH, I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT TODAY
WE'RE ADDING FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS TO GUARDDUTY
EXTENDED THREAT DETECTION. THE NEW CAPABILITIES OFFER ADVANCED
ANALYTICS, IMPROVED ACCURACY WITH REDUCED FALSE POSITIVES,
AND NEW COVERAGE FOR EKS CLUSTERS. COMBINING VISIBILITY
FROM NETWORK AND EKS AUDIT LOGS, AS WELL AS RUNTIME ENVIRONMENTS.
AND THIS ENABLES YOU TO TAKE ACTION ON SEQUENCES OF
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY THAT INDICATE A POTENTIALLY
COMPROMISED AMAZON EKS CLUSTER IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT
COULD LOOK LIKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE,
IT MIGHT BE AN ANOMALOUS DEPLOYMENT OF A PRIVILEGED
CONTAINER, FOLLOWED BY MULTIPLE ATTACK TECHNIQUES LIKE
PERSISTENCE, CRYPTOMINING, REVERSE SHELL CREATION, ALL
PICKED UP BY GUARDDUTY RUNTIME SENSOR AND PRESENTED TO YOU AS A
SINGLE FINDING. THESE ENHANCEMENTS DEMONSTRATE OUR
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE THREAT DETECTION
ACROSS YOUR AWS ENVIRONMENT, HELPING YOUR SECURITY TEAMS
FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS MOST, WHICH IS RESPONDING TO REAL
THREATS FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVELY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT
THE SHEER VOLUME OF INFORMATION AND ALERT FATIGUE MIGHT CAUSE
CRITICAL WARNINGS TO BE IGNORED, AND WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR YOU TO DECIDE WHERE TO FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION. THAT'S WHY TODAY,
I'M ALSO EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THE PREVIEW OF THE ENHANCED AWS
SECURITY HUB. SECURITY HUB IS A UNIFIED CLOUD SECURITY SOLUTION
THAT COMBINES SIGNALS FROM ACROSS AWS SECURITY SERVICES,
AND THEN TRANSFORMS THEM INTO ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS, HELPING YOU
PRIORITIZE YOUR CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES AND RESPOND AT
SCALE. THE NEW CAPABILITIES IN SECURITY HUB BRING TOGETHER THE
BROAD AND DEEP SECURITY SIGNALS FROM ACROSS AWS, CORRELATING AND
ENRICHING THEM TO SURFACE AND PRIORITIZE ACTIVE RISKS. FOR
EXAMPLE, SECURITY HUB CAN COMBINE THE MULTI-STAGE THREATS
DETECTED BY GUARDDUTY EXTENDED THREAT DETECTION WITH OTHER
SIGNALS LIKE VULNERABILITIES, AND PRIORITIZE CRITICAL SECURITY
ISSUES AND HELP YOU SIMPLIFY YOUR OVERALL CLOUD SECURITY
OPERATIONS ACROSS YOUR ENTIRE ORGANIZATION. LET ME DEMONSTRATE
HOW SECURITY HUB SIMPLIFIES SECURITY AT SCALE, AND I'LL JUST
NOTE UP FRONT THAT SOME OF THE FEATURES IN THIS DEMO WILL BE
AVAILABLE IN GA. WE START IN THE SECURITY HUB SUMMARY DASHBOARD
IN THE ORGANIZATION VIEW THAT SHOWS TRENDS OF ACTIVE THREATS,
EXPOSURES, AND RESOURCES WITH VULNERABILITIES OVER TIME. WE
CAN SWITCH TO THE EXPOSURES DASHBOARD WHERE ALL EXPOSURES
ARE GROUPED BY TITLE ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION. IN THIS CASE,
SECURITY HUB FOUND A PUBLICLY EXPOSED EC2 INSTANCE WITH A
HIGHLY EXPLOITABLE VULNERABILITY AND EXCESSIVE PERMISSIONS. WE
CAN CLICK ON THE EXPOSURE TITLE TO EXPAND THE DETAILS, AND HERE
WE CAN SEE ALL RESOURCES FROM MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS AND REGIONS IN
OUR ORGANIZATION THAT ALSO HAVE THIS TYPE OF EXPOSURE. BY
CHOOSING A SPECIFIC RESOURCE, WE GET TO SEE ALL OF THE
INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS EXPOSURE SO THAT WE CAN THEN
INVESTIGATE FURTHER. AT THE VERY TOP, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE
DESCRIPTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE FINDING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE EXPOSURE IS FOR. AND THEN YOU CAN REVIEW ALL OF THE
CONTRIBUTING TRAITS FOR THE FINDING TO UNDERSTAND THE KEY
ITEMS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE CREATION OF THAT EXPOSURE. AND
NEXT, WE NEED TO REVIEW THE POTENTIAL ATTACK PATH RELATED TO
THE RESOURCE THAT THE FINDING IS FOR. WE DO HAVE THE OPTION HERE
OF SWITCHING TO A FULL SCREEN VIEW THAT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT
BETTER VISIBILITY. THE ATTACK PATH HELPS US BETTER UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS RESOURCE IS EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET, AND THE NETWORK
COMPONENTS THAT ARE INVOLVED, AND WE CAN NOW MOVE TO THE
REMEDIATION GUIDANCE TO REVIEW THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
ADDRESSING THE TOP TRAITS. WE CAN EXPAND THE RESOURCE VIEW TO
FIND ALL OF THE ASSETS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EXPOSURE,
AND THEN REVIEW THE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION OF THE
IMPACTED EC2 INSTANCE. AND THIS WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY ANY
INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT FOR THAT REMEDIATION.
WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE OF THE EXPOSURE FINDING,
WE CAN STREAMLINE THE RESPONSE BY OPENING A TICKET DIRECTLY
INTO JIRA SO THAT IT CAN BE RESOLVED BY THE TEAM RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE RESOURCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY WORK IN
ALREADY. AND FINALLY, WE CAN NAVIGATE TO THE RESOURCES
CONSOLE TO DO A SEARCH FOR ALL OTHER EC2 INSTANCES THAT HAVE
THE SAME EXPOSURE FINDING. WHERE ELSE DO I HAVE THIS PROBLEM? WE
FIND THIS IS HOW THE ADVANCED ENHANCED I'M SORRY SECURITY HUB
HELPS YOU DETECT, PRIORITIZE, AND RESPOND TO CRITICAL SECURITY
ISSUES FASTER AND AT SCALE BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT TIME TO ACT
MORE THAN TIME TO DETECT THROUGH AUTOMATED, CORRELATION ENRICHED
CONTEXT, ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS AND STREAMLINED RESPONSE TEAMS CAN
IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND BETTER PROTECT THEIR CLOUD ENVIRONMENT.
I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING AND LOGGING, AND
HOW WE'RE HELPING YOU GET VISIBILITY ACROSS YOUR
ENVIRONMENT, BUT ALL THE MONITORING IN THE WORLD MEANS
NOTHING IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT INCIDENT RESPONSE STRATEGY
TO ACT UPON THOSE FINDINGS AT SPEED AND SCALE. LET ME GIVE YOU
AN EXAMPLE THAT SHOWS THE VALUE OF EARLY DETECTION. LAST YEAR, A
MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DETECTED UNUSUAL API CALLS
ACROSS THEIR PAYMENT PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THEIR MONITORING TOOLS
WERE WORKING PERFECTLY. THEY SAW THIS ANOMALY WITHIN MINUTES. BUT
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT REALLY SHOWS WHY INCIDENT RESPONSE AND
RESILIENCE GO HAND IN HAND. BECAUSE THEY HAD PRACTICED ER
PROCEDURES, THEY COULD IMMEDIATELY ISOLATE THE AFFECTED
SYSTEMS AND THANKS TO THEIR RESILIENT ARCHITECTURE DESIGN,
THEY WERE ABLE TO QUICKLY ROUTE TRANSACTIONS THROUGH BACKUP
PROCESSORS AND MAINTAIN CUSTOMER OPERATIONS. THEY TURNED WHAT
COULD HAVE BEEN A CATASTROPHIC OUTAGE INTO A FOOTNOTE IN THEIR
DAILY OPS REPORT. MOST OF THEIR CUSTOMERS NEVER EVEN NOTICED THE
INCIDENT. OKAY, NEXT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW MIGRATION AND
MODERNIZATION ARE PATHS TO BETTER SECURITY. MIGRATING TO
THE CLOUD REPRESENTS A TRANSFORMATIVE SHIFT IN HOW
ORGANIZATIONS MANAGE SECURITY, OFFERING A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY
MODEL WHERE AWS DOES THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY LIFTING
OF SECURING YOUR UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT YOU CAN
FOCUS ON SECURING YOUR RESOURCES IN TRADITIONAL, ON PREM
ENVIRONMENTS, ORGANIZATIONS BEAR THE FULL BURDEN OF SECURITY,
FROM THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE SOFTWARE AND THE DATA.
CUSTOMERS ON AWS AUTOMATICALLY INHERIT OUR WORLD CLASS PHYSICAL
SECURITY, AND OUR SERVICES INTEGRATE SECURITY DIRECTLY INTO
THEIR DESIGN, ENABLING PROTECTION THAT'S INHERENT
RATHER THAN AN AFTERTHOUGHT. SUCCESS HINGES ON UNDERSTANDING
THAT SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL, ADDRESSING TRANSITIONAL
RISKS AND LEVERAGING CLOUD NATIVE TOOLS TO MAXIMIZE YOUR
SECURITY OUTCOMES. ONE COMPANY THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED
ITS SECURITY CAPABILITIES AFTER MIGRATING TO AWS IS RED SHIELD.
RED SHIELD PROVIDES A WARRANTED RISK REDUCTION MANAGEMENT
SERVICE THAT HELPS THEIR CUSTOMERS THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND,
PRIORITIZE, AND MANAGE SECURITY RISKS ACCORDING TO THEIR
BUSINESS PRIORITIES. BY LEVERAGING AWS GLOBAL
ACCELERATOR, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO SCALE ITS OPERATION TO
80 TO 100 DATA CENTERS, PROVIDING DISTRIBUTED PRESENCE
AND INCREASED RESILIENCY, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REDUCING THEIR
ATTACK SURFACE. THE MIGRATION TO AWS ENABLED RED SHIELD TO
SUCCESSFULLY MITIGATE ATTACKS, PEAKING AT OVER 1.3 TERABITS PER
SECOND, INCLUDING HANDLING 25 MILLION DNS REQUESTS PER SECOND
AND 1.2 HTTP REQUESTS FOR WEB APP LOGINS PER SECOND. RED
SHIELD'S IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE ON AWS ENABLES THEM TO RESOLVE
CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FOR CUSTOMERS IN DAYS INSTEAD OF
MONTHS. MIGRATION TO THE CLOUD BRINGS SUBSTANTIAL SECURITY
BENEFITS, BUT THE ULTIMATE GOAL SHOULD BE MODERNIZATION.
MODERNIZATION HELPS YOU MOVE YOUR SOLUTIONS FURTHER UP THE
STACK AND LEVERAGE MORE MANAGED SERVICES LIKE LAMBDA, S3 OR KMS,
AND THEN BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASED SECURITY THAT COMES
WITH THEM, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON
MANUAL CONFIGURATION, WHICH AS MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM KNOW ARE
PRONE TO HUMAN ERROR. THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THESE
SERVICES IS PATCHED AND MANAGED BY AWS SO THAT YOU CAN FOCUS ON
BUILDING INSTEAD OF MAINTAINING YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AFTER ALL,
THE BEST PATCHING IS THE KIND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO, REGARDLESS
OF WHICH LAYER OF THE STACK YOUR SERVICE RUNS ON, YOU STILL NEED
TO PERFORM REGULAR PATCHING. PATCHING SERVES A CRITICAL ROLE,
ACTING AS FRONTLINE DEFENSE AGAINST VULNERABILITIES THAT
COULD BE USED TO COMPROMISE SYSTEMS, DATA, AND TRUST. IT'S
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE VIEWED HOLISTICALLY ACROSS ALL THE
LAYERS OF YOUR STACK. IN TODAY'S FAST PACED ENVIRONMENTS, THOUGH,
ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN GRAPPLE WITH OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES LIKE THE
VOLUME OF UPDATES, COMPATIBILITY RISKS, DOWNTIME CONCERNS,
VISIBILITY GAPS, AND THIS COULD LEAD TO DEPLOYING UPDATES LESS
FREQUENTLY, WHICH THEN MAKES WHEN YOU DO UPDATE, A MASSIVE
UNDERTAKING THAT REQUIRES A BUNCH OF CROSS TEAM COORDINATION.
TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, ORGANIZATIONS REALLY NEED TO
FOSTER A MINDSET WHERE PATCHING IS INTEGRATED INTO THEIR BROADER
SECURITY AND OPS PRACTICES. CONTINUOUS AUTOMATED DELIVERY
VIA CI CD PIPELINES MAKES THIS A NO BIG DEAL. THE GOAL IS END TO
END AUTOMATION FROM IN-HOUSE SOFTWARE TO INFRASTRUCTURE AS
CODE, AND WITH TOOLS LIKE AMAZON Q DEVELOPER CLI. CREATING THESE
IAC TEMPLATES IS AS EASY AS ONE PROMPT CI CD PIPELINES. THEN
TEST THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF YOUR STACK BY SCANNING YOUR
SOFTWARE, YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE TEMPLATES AND DEPENDENCIES
FOR VULNERABILITIES EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN YOU ALSO
NEED STAGED VALIDATION BY TESTING CHANGES IN PRE-PROD
ENVIRONMENTS TO AVOID PRODUCTION SURPRISES. ALWAYS TEST YOUR
CHANGES THOROUGHLY AND ENSURE ROLLBACK MECHANISMS EXIST TO
MITIGATE ISSUES WITHOUT HARMING YOUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. BUT
WHEN DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION IS DONE RIGHT, PATCHING IS JUST
PART OF DAILY OPERATIONS. SMALL CHANGES ARE FLOWING OUT TO
PRODUCTION ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS, AND THEN OUT-OF-BAND
EMERGENT PATCHING BECOMES A SEPARATE, DISTINCT ACTION THAT'S
SCOPED TO ONLY WHAT YOU NEED TO ADDRESS A ZERO DAY
VULNERABILITY. AWS PROVIDES MANY TOOLS THAT MAKE PATCHING EASIER
ACROSS THE ENTIRE TECHNOLOGY STACK, BEYOND OS LEVEL PATCHING
THROUGH AWS SYSTEMS MANAGER, AWS OFFERS SPECIALIZED SERVICES
ADDRESSING EACH LAYER OF THE STACK FOR CONTAINERIZED
WORKLOADS, AMAZON ECR SCANNING AUTOMATICALLY CHECKS CONTAINER
IMAGES FOR VULNERABILITIES AND PROVIDES REMEDIATION GUIDANCE.
AWS CODEARTIFACT HELPS ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN PRIVATE
REPOSITORIES OF VETTED, PATCHED DEPENDENCIES FOR YOUR
DEVELOPMENT TEAMS, VERIFYING THAT APPLICATIONS ARE BUILT WITH
SECURE COMPONENTS FROM THE START. FINALLY, AMAZON INSPECTOR
AUTOMATICALLY ASSESSES APPLICATIONS FOR VULNERABILITIES
AND DEVIATIONS FROM BEST PRACTICES, AND IT INTEGRATES
DIRECTLY WITH SECURITY HUB TO PROVIDE ACTIONABLE
RECOMMENDATIONS PRIORITIZED BY RISK LEVEL WHILE MIGRATING TO
THE CLOUD AND MODERNIZING LEGACY SYSTEMS UNLOCKS TRANSFORMATIVE
BENEFITS, SCALABILITY, RESILIENCE, AND SECURITY. WE
KNOW THAT THE JOURNEY IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD. ORGANIZATIONS
OFTEN FACE OBSTACLES LIKE UNTANGLING DECADES OF TECHNICAL
DEBT, RETRAINING TEAMS ON CLOUD NATIVE APPLICATIONS AND
PRACTICES, OR RE-ARCHITECTING MONOLITHIC APPS FOR DISTRIBUTED
ENVIRONMENTS. THESE CHALLENGES, IF THEY'RE NAVIGATED ALONE,
MIGHT SLOW YOUR PROGRESS OR INFLATE YOUR COSTS OR LEAD TO
SUBOPTIMAL OUTCOMES. AND THIS IS WHERE TRUSTED PARTNERS BECOME
INVALUABLE. I'D LIKE TO INVITE TO THE STAGE JUSTIN
BRINDLEY-KOONCE, VP OF GO TO MARKET AND SPECIALISTS, TO
EXPLAIN HOW PARTNERS ARE HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS RAISE THEIR
SECURITY POSTURE AND UNLOCK THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. JUSTIN.
[MUSIC] >> WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS
STATEMENT, EVERYTHING STARTS WITH SECURITY. I'M REMINDED THAT
WHEN I STARTED AWS BACK IN 2006, I REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
THIS MEANT OR HOW HARD IT WAS TO MAKE A REALITY. THE IRONY IS
THAT I HAD COME FROM A SECURITY COMPANY, BUT WHEN I ONBOARDED TO
AWS, THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE. HOW COULD IT BE
THAT BUILDER TEAMS WERE DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE WORLD,
AND YET EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURITY. YES, YOU
NEED TOP DOWN PRIORITIZATION. YOU NEED GREAT MECHANISMS. YOU
NEED TRAINING. YOU NEED TOOLS. YOU NEED ALL THOSE THINGS. BUT
YOU CAN'T CONFIDENTLY SAY EVERYTHING STARTS WITH SECURITY
UNLESS IT'S PART OF YOUR CULTURE. AND AT AWS, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO SEE FIRSTHAND IS HOW OUR CULTURE OF
SECURITY IS PROPPED UP BY THIS STRONG COMMUNITY. THE MORE
PEOPLE THAT TALK AND ENGAGE ON SECURITY, THE MORE IT'S
AMPLIFIED AS A NORMAL PART OF YOUR DISCUSSIONS, DESIGNS,
DEPLOYMENTS, OPERATIONS, SUPPORT. IT'S EVERYWHERE.
INSTEAD OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT. AND WITH OUR SECURITY COMMUNITY, WE
HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS, EXPERTS WITH DEEP KNOWLEDGE
ACROSS SECURITY DOMAINS. THESE FOLKS WORK ALONGSIDE SERVICE
TEAMS, OUR PARTNERS, OUR CUSTOMERS, TO ENSURE THAT
SECURITY IS CARRIED THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND THAT
WE'RE PROVIDING THE RIGHT RESOURCES TO HELP YOU SOLVE THE
MOST DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX SECURITY CHALLENGES. FOR
EXAMPLE, WHEN WE STARTED GETTING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO SECURE
GENERATIVE AI WORKLOADS, A CROSS-FUNCTIONAL TEAM ACROSS OUR
COMMUNITY OF SECURITY EXPERTS GOT TOGETHER TO UNPACK WHAT WE
WERE EXPERIENCING OURSELVES AND WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM OUR
CUSTOMERS. THE RESULT WAS THIS GENERATIVE AI SECURITY SCOPING
MATRIX. IT SIMPLIFIES HOW TO FOCUS IN AND ASSESS AND
IMPLEMENT SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AI LIFE CYCLE,
NO MATTER YOUR INDUSTRY OR YOUR USE CASE. LET'S ALSO, OF COURSE
NOT FORGET ABOUT OUR PARTNER NETWORK. IT'S A MULTIPLIER WHEN
IT COMES TO COMMUNITIES SECURITY SPECIALISTS. THESE PARTNERS HAVE
DEEP AND DIVERSE SETS OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE THAT I
LOVE SEEING CUSTOMERS LEVERAGE. IN PARTICULAR, I'M REALLY PROUD
OF THE SHEER BREADTH OF OUR MSSP PARTNER NETWORK AVAILABLE TO
EVERYONE, AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR SECURITY
COMMUNITY, OR TO HELP PROTECT OR EVEN FULLY MANAGE THEIR
WORKLOADS. AND I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE HAVE ENHANCED
OUR AWS MSSP SPECIALIZATION FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU CAN MORE
EASILY IDENTIFY PARTNERS WITH PROVEN EXPERTISE IN THE SECURITY
TOOLS THAT YOU USE, WHETHER THIRD PARTY OR AWS. WE'VE ALWAYS
HAD A HIGH BAR FOR THESE SECURITY SPECIALIZATIONS, BUT
WE'RE NOW FURTHER VALIDATING CAPABILITIES BY LOOKING AT
CUSTOMER REFERENCES AND REAL WORLD IMPLEMENTATIONS TO ENSURE
OUR PARTNERS CAN SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THE EVER CHANGING
REALITIES OF THE SECURITY LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING AI AND
MULTI-CLOUD. THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE CHECK THE BOX EXERCISE,
BUT PARTNERS ARE SHOWING UP AND WE'RE EXCITED TO BE WORKING WITH
THEM. SPEAKING OF A CHANGING SECURITY LANDSCAPE ACROSS THE
ENTIRE PARTNER COMMUNITY, WE'RE SEEING SOME FANTASTIC
INNOVATIONS THAT ARE TRANSFORMING SECURITY WITH
GENERATIVE AI. SUCH AS TERRORIST SECURITY, AN AWS PARTNER THAT
DEVELOPED AN AI PLATFORM THAT ENABLES CONTINUOUS
SEMI-AUTONOMOUS PENETRATION TESTING THAT DOUBLES THE
COVERAGE OF ATTACK SURFACES, IMPROVES ACCURACY, AND CUTS TEST
DURATION BY OVER 50%. VERY COOL. OR TWINE THAT DEVELOPED AN AI
POWERED DIGITAL EMPLOYEE TRAINED AND EDUCATED IN IDENTITY
PROCESSES, IT UNDERSTANDS, LEARNS, AND TAKES AWAY THE
BURDEN OF IDENTITY MANAGEMENT. MANAGEMENT WORK. IT'S BEEN SHOWN
TO REDUCE MANUAL IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT WORK BY UP TO
70%. WHAT A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT OUR FUTURE HOLDS, AND
THAT'S JUST A GLIMPSE OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE. WE HAVE AN ENTIRE
SPECIALIZATION TO DEDICATED SECURITY, AND SOME OF THE
WORLD'S LARGEST PARTNERS IN THE WORLD ARE RIGHT HERE WITH US,
READY TO HELP YOU SECURE YOUR AI ENVIRONMENT AND PROTECT YOU
AGAINST EMERGING AI THREATS. ALL RIGHT. THE WORLD HAS CHANGED A
LOT SINCE I JOINED AWS, BUT THE CULTURE OF SECURITY IS HERE, AND
IT'S ONLY STRENGTHENED OVER THE YEARS AND EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A
COMMUNITY OF PARTNERS, ALL HERE TO HELP YOU CONFIDENTLY SOLVE
EVEN YOUR MOST COMPLEX SECURITY CHALLENGES. SO WHEN YOU'RE HERE
AT RE:INFORCE, CONNECT WITH THE SPECIALIST, TALK TO A PARTNER,
AND SIMPLIFY YOUR SECURITY JOURNEY. THANK YOU EVERYONE!
>> THANK YOU JUSTIN. IT'S GREAT TO SEE HOW OUR PARTNERS ARE
SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF SECURITY. THE
LAST THING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS HOW SECURITY,
WHEN DONE RIGHT, CAN BE A TRUE ENABLER IN ADOPTING NEW
TECHNOLOGIES, OF COURSE, INCLUDING GENERATIVE AI. WHAT
WE'RE NOTICING IS THAT CUSTOMERS WITH MATURE SECURITY PRACTICES
AND THE ABILITY TO INNOVATE WHILE MAINTAINING A HIGH
SECURITY BAR, THEY'RE ADOPTING GEN AI FASTER. IT'S NO SURPRISE
THAT LARGE ENTERPRISES IN FINANCE, HEALTHCARE AND TELECOMS
ARE LEVERAGING GEN AI TO BUILD INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. IT'S
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT SECURITY CONTROLS AND
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES, WIDESPREAD DATA ENCRYPTION,
STRONG ACCESS MANAGEMENT, UBIQUITOUS AUDIT TRAILS. ALL OF
THIS ENABLES THEM TO REDUCE RISKS AND PRAGMATICALLY FOCUS ON
SCALING THEIR USE CASES. THESE PREEXISTING CONTROLS STREAMLINE
COMPLIANCE WHILE LOWERING BARRIERS TO EXPERIMENTATION. FOR
EXAMPLE, INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN ACCELERATE CLAIMS PROCESSING
USING GENERATIVE AI WHILE MAINTAINING EXPLAINABILITY AND
ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH CHAINS OF DECISIONS THAT ALIGN WITH THEIR
TRANSPARENCY MANDATES. ONE COMPANY THAT STARTED IN THE
ENTERPRISE AI SPACE AND HAS SPENT YEARS THINKING ABOUT
GUARDRAILS AND SECURITY IN THE GEN AI SPACES WRITER. THEY ARE
BRINGING ACCURATE, RELIABLE AI AGENTS TO THE GLOBAL 2000. LET'S
ROLL A VIDEO. >> I THINK IN TEN YEARS THERE
ARE GOING TO BE TWO TYPES OF COMPANIES AI FIRST COMPANIES AND
DEAD COMPANIES. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE TOOLS THAT YOU
USE EVERY DAY SHAPE YOU, AND IN SO MANY WAYS, CREATE THE
CONTAINER OF WHAT YOU THINK IS POSSIBLE.
[MUSIC] WRITER IS THAT END TO END
PLATFORM FOR REINVENTING EVERY PROCESS INSIDE OF AN ENTERPRISE
AI FIRST, GENERATIVE AI REALLY SHORTENS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN
CONCEPTION AND REALITY. IT IS SUCH A DIFFERENT WAY TO WORK
COMPARED TO THE LAST DECADE. SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DID WAS CLICK
BOXES 800 TIMES A DAY. WE ARE BUILDING A AGENTIC SYSTEMS THAT
ARE ABLE TO PROCESS RECORDS FROM MULTIPLE DATABASES AND CREATE
TOOLS THAT ALLOW AN EXPLOSION OF CREATIVITY. YOU NEED A POWERFUL
MODEL TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS IS SUCH A
BIG PART OF OUR ABILITY TO BE AN ENTERPRISE GRADE AGENT BUILDER
PLATFORM. WE'VE TRAINED OUR MODELS ON SAGEMAKER HYPERPOD,
AND IT HAS RESULTED IN SEAMLESS SCALING FROM PROTOTYPE TO
PRODUCTION. WE'VE GOT THE ABILITY TO PROCESS A MILLION
TOKENS IN 22 SECONDS AND CALL A TOOL IN 0.3 SECONDS, AND THAT IS
BECAUSE OF AWS. WE WORK ON THE TECHNOLOGY OF YES, CAN AGENTIC
AI DO X? YES. CAN AGENTIC I DO Y? YES. AND WE REALLY GET TO
PARTNER WITH CUSTOMERS THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THEIR
BUSINESSES. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS SO DEMOCRATIZING. IF YOU CAN
WRITE IT, IF YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT, YOU CAN BUILD IT. AND SO
MUCH OF THAT EXCITING FUTURE IS REALLY RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.
>> COOL. AND YOU CAN APPLAUD. IT'S OKAY. IT'S GOOD. CIRCULATES
THE BLOOD. AT AWS, OUR TEAMS HAVE BEEN LEVERAGING THE SAME
SERVICES AND INDUSTRY LEADING LLMS THAT YOU CAN ACCESS ON
BEDROCK TO BUILD TOOLS THAT ENABLE THEM TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH
LESS. GENERATIVE. GENERATIVE AI IS NOT A PANACEA, OBVIOUSLY, BUT
IT IS EXTREMELY PROFICIENT AT CERTAIN TASKS LIKE ANALYZING
TEXT, CORRELATING UNSTRUCTURED INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE
SOURCES TO HELP US QUICKLY IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE ISSUES.
AND THESE CUSTOM TOOLS NOT ONLY HELP OUR TEAMS WORK MORE
EFFICIENTLY, THEY ALSO EMBED SECURITY PRACTICES DIRECTLY INTO
DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOWS TO SHARE MORE ABOUT SOME OF THESE TOOLS
AND HOPEFULLY INSPIRE YOU TO BUILD SOMETHING BETTER. I'D LIKE
TO INVITE ON STAGE GEORGE ARGYROS.
[MUSIC] >> THANK YOU AMY. HELLO
EVERYONE. I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHOW YOU HOW OUR
TEAMS ARE ABLE TO SOLVE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS AND GET MORE
EFFICIENT USING GENERATIVE AI. MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM HAVE
HEARD MATT GARMAN TALK PUBLICLY AT RE:INVENT ABOUT HOW WE
SHIFTED THE WHOLE COMPANY FROM INTERNAL JAVA 11 TO JAVA 18
USING AMAZON Q DEVELOPER JAVA CODE TRANSFORMATION. WE NOW USE
A SIMILAR PROCESS TO RESOLVE SECURITY ISSUES IN OUR CODE
BASES. THE WAY WE DO THIS IS BY USING AN INTERNAL VERSION OF
AMAZON Q DEVELOPER TO PULL SECURITY BEST PRACTICES AND HELP
OUR ENGINEERS ADDRESS PROBLEMS FASTER. THE APPLICATION NOT ONLY
HELPS SOLVE INDIVIDUAL SECURITY ISSUES, BUT IT ALSO ENABLES OUR
TEAMS TO RAISE THE BAR BY ENSURING THEY USE THE MOST
SECURE LIBRARIES AND DESIGN PATTERNS. INSTEAD OF HAVING
DEVELOPERS STEP OUT OF THEIR DEV LIFECYCLE, WE MAKE IT PART OF
THEIR DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. SHIFTING SECURITY LEFT SQUASHING
PROBLEMS EARLY IN THE PROCESS. THE APPLICATION PERFORMS
SECURITY CHECKS DURING PULL REQUESTS, AND IF IT IDENTIFIES
AN ISSUE, IT GENERATES A CODE REVIEW AND A PATH. LET'S SEE IT
IN ACTION. CODE REVIEWS FOR SECURITY ISSUES CAN BE INITIATED
IN TWO WAYS. A CODE REVIEW CAN BE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN
A SECURITY FINDING IS IDENTIFIED DURING A PULL REQUEST. HOWEVER,
WE CAN ALSO USE THE CLI TO INITIATE AD HOC CODE REVIEWS FOR
SPECIFIC CODE PACKAGE. AND ALTHOUGH NOT VISIBLE HERE, WE
ALSO HAVE TOOLS TO GENERATE THESE COMMANDS AUTOMATICALLY AND
AT SCALE ON BEHALF OF OUR BUILDERS. THE CODE ANALYSIS
COMPLETES WITHIN A FEW SECONDS AND GENERATES A FULL REPORT OF
THE FINDINGS. I CAN NOW CLICK ON THE URL PROVIDED BY THE TOOL SO
I CAN REVIEW ISSUES IDENTIFIED ALONG WITH THE MITIGATION
RECOMMENDATIONS. THE CODE REVIEW DESCRIPTION PROVIDES ALL THE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED, AS WELL AS THE CODE
FIXES THAT APPLIED AND THE NEXT STEPS FOR OUR BUILDERS. THIS IS
CRUCIAL AS IT PROVIDES THE NECESSARY CONTEXT FOR WHEN WE
SWITCH TO THE CODE REVIEW NEXT. IN THE FILED FOR CODE REVIEW, WE
CAN SEE THE BEFORE AND AFTER CODE WITH ALL THE FIXES
SUGGESTED BY THE TOOL. ALL THIS HAS HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF OUR CODE
REPOSITORY. THE EXISTING CODE IS STILL UNPATCHED, AND WE CAN
QUICKLY JUMP TO THE ORIGINAL FILE TO REVIEW THE CONTENTS. WE
CAN ALSO JUMP TO THE NEWLY CREATED BRANCH WITH THE PATCH
CODE. AFTER REVIEWING THE AUTOMATED FIX AND MAKING SURE
THAT IT ADDRESSES ALL THE ISSUES CORRECTLY, WE CAN AUTOMATICALLY
MERGE THE PATCH WITH JUST ONE CLICK. AND JUST LIKE THAT, OUR
SECURITY PATCH HAS BEEN MERGED TO OUR SOURCE CONTROL AND IT'S
READY TO BE TESTED AND DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION. JUMPING BACK TO
THE MAIN BRANCH IN OUR SOURCE CONTROL, WE CAN SEE THAT THE
LATEST MERGE IS OURS. AND JUST LIKE THAT, THE CODE IS FULLY
PATCHED. AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE HOW
QUICKLY WE IDENTIFY AND FIX SECURITY ISSUES. NEW CODE. BUT
BOTH PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY ARE CRITICAL. THE SYSTEM USES A
NUMBER OF SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT WASTING ENGINEERS
TIME BY PRODUCING INVALID FIXES OR BREAKING CODE. FOR EXAMPLE,
WE USE AI AGENTS TO RUN TESTS ON THE GENERATED CODE FIXES AND
AUTOMATICALLY FIX ISSUES BASED ON THE GENERATED ERRORS. THE
AGENTS ALSO EVALUATE THAT THE PATCH IS ACCURATE. OUR GOAL FOR
2025 IS TO DELIVER A 5% IMPROVEMENT ON BUILDER
EFFICIENCY THROUGH AUTOMATED FIXED GENERATION, AND THIS IS
ONLY THE BEGINNING. ANOTHER INTERNAL CHALLENGE THAT GEN AI
IS HELPING US SOLVE IS SCALING THE APPSYNC REVIEW PROCESS. AT
AWS, SECURITY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY, SO EVERY NEW FEATURE
AND SERVICE HAS TO GO THROUGH AN APPSEC REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT IT
MEETS OUR HIGH SECURITY STANDARDS. HOWEVER, APPSEC
REVIEWS TAKE RESOURCES AND TIME AND NEED TO BE PRIORITIZED
ACCORDINGLY. IN ADDITION, BUILDERS MAY HAVE SECURITY
BLOCKERS THAT REQUIRES INPUT FROM THE SECURITY TEAM. SO WE
BUILT A SECURITY FOCUSED GEN AI CHATBOT TO GIVE DEVELOPERS
GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND REDUCE
ISSUES BEFORE THE SECURITY REVIEW. THE LLM THAT POWERS IS
CHATBOT USES AN AGENT TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND ANSWER QUESTIONS, IN
EFFECT SPEEDING UP THE WHOLE PROCESS AND FREEING UP ENGINEERS
TIME TO TACKLE HARDER PROBLEMS. THOSE NOT EASILY SOLVED BY LLMS.
NOW, AS AMY MENTIONED EARLIER, AWS IS BUILT ON APIS. THEREFORE,
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE THOROUGHLY AND EXHAUSTIVELY TEST
ALL OUR APIS. HOWEVER, WRITING EFFECTIVE TESTS THAT CAN
METHODICALLY TEST FOR EVERY SCENARIO, INCLUDING EDGE CASES,
IS A TEDIOUS AND TIME CONSUMING TASK. YOU NEED TO READ THE
DOCUMENTATION, FIGURE OUT THE LIMITS, AND USE CASES NEEDED TO
BE TESTED, AND SET UP THE NECESSARY CONTEXT, ALONG WITH
THE APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS THAT WILL BE SENT AS PART OF THE TEST
CODE. NOW IMAGINE DOING THIS FOR HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF TESTS.
INSTEAD, WE'VE BUILT AN AGENTIC WORKFLOW THAT CAN DIGEST THE
DOCUMENTATION ALONG WITH THE STRUCTURAL INFORMATION OF THE
APIS, BUILD TEST CASES AUTOMATICALLY, AND REFINE THOSE
TESTS UNTIL THEY RUN SUCCESSFULLY. LLMS ALSO HELP
SPEED UP THE TEST CYCLE BY IDENTIFYING THE EXTERNAL
RESOURCES NEEDED TO RUN THE TESTS, LIKE AN S3 BUCKET. FOR
EXAMPLE, TODAY WE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE SECURITY TESTS FOR A
LARGE PORTION OF THE AWS SERVICE APIS. RECENTLY, WE'VE BEEN
EXTENDING THIS APPROACH EVEN FURTHER. WE ARE USING LLMS NOT
ONLY TO GENERATE THE NECESSARY CONTEXT AND PARAMETERS FOR
CALLING AN API, BUT ALSO TO UNDERSTAND WHICH SECURITY
PROPERTIES NEED TO BE TESTED FOR EACH API AND VERIFY THAT THE
TEST COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. AI AGENTS USING PUBLIC AWS
DOCUMENTATION CAN UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST INVOKE APIS THAT
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR, AND WHETHER AN API EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY.
THE AGENTS WILL TRY AS A TEST AND USE THE RESULTS TO FIX ANY
INACCURACIES IN THE TEST ITSELF. THIS APPROACH NOT ONLY HELPS US
DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY TEST CASES, BUT TO ALSO
UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR DOCUMENTATION
THAT THOUSANDS OF BUILDERS USE DAILY. I REALLY HOPE THAT WHAT
WE'VE ACHIEVED WILL INSPIRE YOU TO BUILD YOUR OWN TOOLS. THANK
YOU. [MUSIC]
>> THANKS, GEORGE. IT'S COOL TO SEE THE INNOVATION AND TOOLS
THAT OUR TEAMS ARE BUILDING. ANOTHER INTERNAL TEAM THAT HAS
SEEN TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES FROM USING GENERATIVE AI AS OUR
CLOUD RESPONSE TEAM. WHEN SECURITY ISSUES ARISE, EVERY
SECOND, EVERY MINUTE COUNTS. AND BY INTEGRATING GEN AI INTO OUR
CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, WE'VE ACHIEVED OVER A 40% REDUCTION IN
MEAN TIME TO RESOLVE FOR AVERAGE COMPLEXITY ISSUES WHILE
SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVING THE DEPTH AND CONSISTENCY OF OUR
SECURITY DOCUMENTATION. OUR AI POWERED STRUCTURED TRIAGE SYSTEM
NOW AUTOMATICALLY ANSWERS MORE THAN 50 KEY QUESTIONS PER
SECURITY CASE AND SUGGESTS QUESTIONS TO GO EVEN DEEPER,
ENABLING FASTER, MORE THOROUGH DOCUMENTATION, WHILE AT THE SAME
TIME HELPING WITH CONSISTENT PRIORITIZATION AND RESPONSE.
WE'VE ALSO BUILT SYSTEMS THAT ARE ABLE TO SEARCH OUR PAST
CASES AT SCALE, OFFERING A CAPABILITY TO ANALYZE PATTERNS
OF ISSUES THAT HELPS US ZOOM OUT AND IDENTIFY WHERE WE CAN ENGAGE
FOR THE HIGHEST RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT. AND ON THE FLIP
SIDE, TO AVOID POTENTIAL OVERRELIANCE ON AI ASSISTANTS,
WE'VE DEVELOPED DRIFT DETECTION SYSTEMS THAT ANALYZE OUR ISSUES
AND FLAG WHEN OUR RESPONSE OR DOCUMENTATION NEEDS ENHANCEMENT.
FOR ANYONE THAT HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH SECURITY LOG ANALYSIS, YOU
KNOW IT'S ONE OF THE MOST TIME CONSUMING ASPECTS OF SECURITY
OPERATIONS. OUR TEAMS PREVIOUSLY SPENT AN AVERAGE OF 9.5 HOURS
PER LOG ANALYSIS JOB. IT'S BRUTAL. OUR NEW AI POWERED LOG
ANALYSIS SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSES LOGS FROM MULTIPLE
SOURCES, TRANSFORMING WHAT WAS ONCE A MANUAL, TIME INTENSIVE
PROCESS INTO AN AUTOMATED FIRST PASS ANALYSIS THAT COMPLETES IN
MINUTES RATHER THAN HOURS. THIS SYSTEM EMPLOYS AN ENTITY DRIVEN
APPROACH THAT AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTS AND ANALYZES RELEVANT
LOGS, IDENTIFY SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS, MAPS, COMMUNICATION
FLOWS, AND PROVIDE SECURITY ENGINEERS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE
STARTING POINT FOR THEIR INVESTIGATIONS. THE IMPACT OF
THIS HAS BEEN DRAMATIC A 50 TIMES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE IN
LOG ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES, AND A REDUCTION IN INITIAL ANALYSIS
TIME FROM HOURS TO MINUTES. IT'S HELPING OUR SECURITY ENGINEERS
GET TO THE PART THEY NEED TO START WITH SIMPLY AND QUICKLY.
NOW, IF YOU'RE FEELING INSPIRED BY ALL THIS AND YOU WANT TO
BUILD SIMILAR TOOLS FOR YOUR BUSINESS, GOOD NEWS. WE RECENTLY
PUBLISHED THE AWS WELL ARCHITECTED GENERATIVE AI LENS.
THIS PROVIDES ALL OF THE BEST PRACTICES FOR DESIGNING AND
OPERATING GEN AI WORKLOADS ON AWS. AT AWS, WE ARE ALWAYS
LOOKING FOR MEANINGFUL WAYS TO USE GENERATIVE AI TO IMPROVE THE
WAY YOU WORK. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INTEGRATING
GEN AI INTO YOUR SOLUTIONS CAN BE DONE SECURELY AND
RESPONSIBLY. WITH AMAZON BEDROCK, WE PROVIDE YOU WITH THE
BEST MODEL CHOICE AND ENABLE YOU TO FIND THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE
RIGHT JOB. LAST YEAR, WE TALKED ABOUT HOW SECURITY IS DEEPLY
INTEGRATED INTO EVERYTHING HERE AT AWS, INCLUDING BEDROCK, FROM
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALL THE WAY TO THE TOOLS AND FEATURES THAT
ENABLE YOU TO BUILD YOUR GEN AI SOLUTIONS. WITH THE MODEL
LANDSCAPE CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING AND NEW MODELS BEING IN HIGH
DEMAND, WE WANT OUR CUSTOMERS TO BE ABLE TO USE THEIR PREFERRED
MODELS WITH THE SAME CONFIDENCE AS USING ANY OTHER AWS SERVICE.
USING NEWER, MORE POWERFUL MODELS COULD PROVIDE A
COMPETITIVE EDGE FOR MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, AND SO EARLY
AVAILABILITY IS PARAMOUNT. WE THOROUGHLY TEST THIRD PARTY
MODELS TO MAKE SURE THEY MEET OUR HIGH SECURITY BAR BEFORE
OFFERING THEM TO OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH BEDROCK AND THIS
PROCESS, I'M GOING TO BE HONEST, USED TO TAKE US WEEKS. WE KNEW
THIS WASN'T ALIGNED TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF US. YOU WANT
ACCESS TO THE LATEST MODELS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE WAY WE
FIXED THIS WAS BY CREATING A STANDARDIZED DEPLOYMENT
ARCHITECTURE THAT AUTOMATED MOST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND MODEL
SECURITY TESTS, AND THEN BUILDING A TOOL TO RUN THESE AT
SCALE. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE MANUAL EFFORT WE
NEEDED, AND IT ALLOWS US TO SAFELY GET MODELS INTO YOUR
HANDS FASTER. NOW, OUR CUSTOMERS CAN LEVERAGE BEDROCK AND CHOOSE
FROM STATE OF THE ART LLMS TO BUILD NEW TOOLS AND
CAPABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, BMW HAS BUILT A SYSTEM ON TOP OF
BEDROCK TO CONTINUOUSLY OPTIMIZE THEIR CLOUD RESOURCES AND SCALE
THEIR OWN OPERATIONS. THE BMW GROUP MANAGES OVER 23 MILLION
VEHICLES CONNECTED TO ITS CONNECTED VEHICLE, BACKEND,
WHICH IS HOSTED ON AWS, AND THIS GENERATES APPROXIMATELY 17
BILLION REQUESTS AND 197TB OF DATA PER DAY. USING OVER 1000
MICROSERVICES OPERATING AT THAT SCALE, THEY WANTED TO BUILD A
GEN AI SOLUTION THAT CAN HELP THEIR ENGINEERS MANAGE THEIR
INFRASTRUCTURE MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND SO BMW HAS BUILT THE CONSOLE
CLOUD ASSISTANT IKA ON AMAZON BEDROCK TO CONTINUOUSLY OPTIMIZE
THEIR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE AND SCALE THEIR OPERATIONS ACROSS
MORE THAN 1300 CLOUD ACCOUNTS. THE TOOL ANALYZES THE RESOURCES
AND NOT ONLY COMES UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT IT ALSO
PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO DEPLOY THE APPROPRIATE FIXES WITH THE
PUSH OF A BUTTON, AND THIS HELPS THEIR ENGINEERS EFFICIENTLY
MANAGE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW
THE BMW GROUP IS UNDERGOING ENTERPRISE GRADE AI
TRANSFORMATION. USING GENERATIVE AI ACROSS THEIR WHOLE VALUE
CHAIN TO CONTINUOUSLY OPTIMIZE THEIR WORKFLOWS AND PRODUCTS.
GENERATIVE AI IS  RESHAPING WHAT'S POSSIBLE. IT'S
REDEFINING HOW WE WRITE CODE, CREATE, AND SERVE CUSTOMERS. BUT
ADOPTING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AI AT SCALE DOESN'T JUST REQUIRE
COMPUTE POWER OR DATA MODELS, IT REQUIRES A SECURE FOUNDATION.
THE FOUR AREAS THAT WE COVERED TODAY WITHIN SECURITY, IDENTITY
AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT, DATA AND NETWORK SECURITY, MONITORING AND
INCIDENT RESPONSE, AND MIGRATION AND MODERNIZATION. THESE ARE NOT
BARRIERS FOR YOU. THEY ARE ENABLERS, AND AWS IS MAKING IT
EASIER FOR YOU TO MEET YOUR SECURITY GOALS WITH BUILT IN
SERVICES, PRESCRIPTIVE GUIDANCE AND PARTNER SUPPORT. WHEN YOU
HAVE A SECURE FOUNDATION, YOUR TEAMS CAN EXPERIMENT, BUILD, AND
SHIP WITH CONFIDENCE. THAT'S THE REAL TAKEAWAY. A SECURE
FOUNDATION DOESN'T SLOW YOU DOWN. IT SPEEDS YOU UP. IT
REMOVES FRICTION. IT GIVES THE TEAMS CONFIDENCE TO ADOPT,
EXPERIMENT AND INNOVATE FASTER. BECAUSE GUARDRAILS ARE ALREADY
IN PLACE. THAT'S WHY SECURITY ISN'T JUST A PRIORITY. IT'S A
IT'S REALLY A PREREQUISITE FOR INNOVATION. IT'S NOT THE END
GOAL. SECURITY IS WHAT GETS YOU TO YOUR GOALS FASTER, SAFER, AND
WITH MORE IMPACT. THANKS FOR SPENDING TIME WITH ME THIS
MORNING FOLKS. I HOPE YOU HAVE A FANTASTIC SHOW. WELCOME TO
RE:INFORCE.
