## Summary
A 20-year cybersecurity veteran discusses shifting focus from prevention and detection to response and recovery preparedness. The speaker emphasizes that while organizations invest heavily in building security walls, they often lack adequate preparation for when those defenses fail. The talk introduces the concept of prioritizing recovery planning with three critical priorities: identity/access systems, communications platforms, and critical applications. The speaker advocates for proactive recovery testing through tools like "recovery range" simulations rather than relying solely on tabletop exercises.

## Key Points
- Traditional security focus has been heavily weighted toward prevention and detection, with insufficient attention to response and recovery
- Organizations need a clear priority order for recovery: identity/access, communications, then critical applications
- Recovery priorities vary significantly by business type (hospitals vs. payroll companies vs. small businesses)
- Testing recovery capabilities through simulation is more effective than theoretical tabletop exercises
- Recovery planning should focus on rapid decision-making under pressure with imperfect information
- The "recovery range" concept allows organizations to practice recovery scenarios in simulated environments
- Business continuity planning must be tailored to specific organizational priorities and critical functions

## Technical Details
- **Recovery Range Simulation**: Environment emulation platform for testing recovery scenarios against actual workloads and services
- **Critical System Prioritization Framework**:
  - Primary: Identity and access systems (Active Directory, etc.)
  - Secondary: Communications platforms (email alternatives, secure messaging)
  - Tertiary: Business-critical applications specific to organization type
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: Framework for determining organizational recovery priorities
- **Incident Response Planning**: Structured approach to rapid decision-making during security incidents
- **AWS Marketplace Integration**: Recovery assessment tools and services available through AWS marketplace
- **Cyber Range Technology**: Simulation platforms adapted for recovery scenario testing

Hello. Hey everybody, uh, so my name is Bill O'Connell. I'll be chatting with you about the chief security officer's perspective, um, on cyber readiness, um, and, uh, a little bit of a background on me, this is my 20th year in cybersecurity. Um, very exciting for me, a big milestone. I also feel old, um, but, uh, you know, I've seen cybersecurity and resiliency in many different companies started off in Deloitte doing projects for other companies, helping them get ready. Then, um, also worked, uh, at ADP, uh, so it was very interesting to be in kind of a software focused space around HR payroll. Spent some time at Roche in the medical device space, so again, a very different industry from the regulatory side, also from what you're protecting, very different, um, and then a few months ago I joined Convo. And part of the reason I was excited to give this talk is that part of what I'm explaining today is my own personal feeling about kind of why I took the role as well as something that I think is important for everybody to to share and connect on um but um. Yeah, so in terms of uh the sky is falling slide, here it is. Um, what I think is interesting though is You know, breaches suck. We see incidents all the time and you see if you've lived through one. You know how awful it is, how painful, how time consuming, and then you wind up spending a lot of money fixing it, um, ransomware, same thing, it's like somebody comes and robs you and then, uh, disrupts your whole business and then you have to tackle with the thought of am I gonna actually pay them a lot of money to start over again, um. It's a requirement at any conference to mention AI, but it's really fascinating to me to see so much of what we've been trying to do is either security for AI. How do you secure the business using AI or the reverse, right? How can I use AI to improve my security, but also we have to realize that the bad guys are also figuring out how can they use AI to circumvent everything you've done in security and with the gains if we're not caught up on that, that could be very, uh, that could be a very easy way for a threat actor uh to give you a hard day. And then finally. How quick can you recover, right? And so statistics show that it usually takes companies a really long time to recover. So I don't do all the fud for no reason. I think the important lesson there for me is when you think back to, uh, whenever you started in security, whether it's the CIA triad, right, availability is one of the three core pillars or when you look at ISO and the business continuity focused ISO standards or in NIST about respond and recover. In the security playbook is already a lot about resiliency, recovery, availability yet if I'm being honest in my own personal, uh, kind of background, the past 5 to 10 years I've definitely put more focus on the prevent side and the detect side. And I think you know again part of the reason I took the role was I was really interested and I found this eye opening to say, am I doing enough on the recovery side? So yes, there's disaster recovery in IT and yes we've done business continuity and BIA business impact analysis documents and we've tried to worry about so many different things. But have we really focused on what if there was a ransomware attack or what if there was a very significant disruption, what would I do and what would I do first? So that's what uh you know for me I think is the really important thing, not just building the wall higher uh or to use a more, you know, kind of visceral analogy, you know, if you're a boxer, you get punched how good do you get back up? How good are you at at dealing with that situation. The boxer whose strategy is never get punched in the face, is probably not going to be very successful. So My personal goal is to focus more on response and recovery, and I wanted to talk about that because, you know, again, I think it's important as a focus, but also what does that mean and what do you do first? So having that plan of figuring out where should I focus and what my priorities would be and then also testing it to make sure that you, your team, the organization has that muscle memory to be able to do it when you need to because again if you've lived through any sort of incident or any sort of uh really bad day in the security world. You know it's crazy, right? You know that the, the fog of what's happening in an incident when you're dealing with imperfect information or in a ransomware attack, you don't have the luxury of time, you don't have the luxury of, um, kind of, uh, doing things perfectly. You have to act, you have to act fast and so if you're scrambling because you don't have that planned out, it's much more stress and it's much slower. So for me what I think about first is literally going in order of if nothing worked, what would I do first? So critical for me would be, can I have my identity and access can I have active directory, whatever, uh, you know, other tool use, can I get that up and running in a trusted way so that I, I know where to start? And the second piece would be how do we work. Together, so do I have communications right? if my email's compromised or Chad is compromised, how are we gonna talk to each other? Are we all gonna now, you know, do our whole business over signal or is there, you know, a secondary platform that I can use to do communications, share documents, get people together on a call that's, you know, secured. And finally now what are those critical applications that I have to get back up and running and the reason I focus on this again there's so much around business continuity in general, but what does that mean for your business right? So when I mentioned the organizations I've been at before for a hospital. That's gonna be very specific. Perhaps you know the uh systems in life support and uh providing patient care, that's gonna be their primary focus versus a payroll company. Their focus is going to be on making sure that all the millions of people that get paid through their service are getting paid. So what's your priority is gonna be very different based on what your business is. And yet a small business might look at payroll and say, well, hey, we'll we'll pay people in cash or or that hospital might defer paying its people to keep patients alive. So really knowing again in a in a perfect world you could say, oh well, we would do these 35 things but when something actually happens and you go through that disruption. You're gonna have to act quickly. You're gonna have to know what that order is, and you're not gonna have time to debate. You really need to know what that plan is. So, um, As somebody who's not a sales guy, uh, I love that there are things that that my company is doing that you know you can just engage in like so if you say how would I get started, what are things I could do because yes I know we do business continuity, but what would I do first? Um, I personally was really impressed with this uh kind of uh activity you can do called the recovery range. If you've ever done a cyber range, it's a very similar construct, but you can emulate your environment to the extent that you wanna share it you can then role play situations where you're seeing the services, the workloads, the things that you really use in your, uh, organization. And you can actually test it so it's not just a tabletop exercise where you're talking through something, but you can actually see, can I recover this when I try, does it work? What did I get wrong? What should I do differently the next time? So it's a way that you can actually see, you know, am I ready for this? And so you still need to do all those other activities like the business impact analysis, tabletop exercises if they're done right, but what I like about it is not just an audit kind of check the box yes we've done, uh, our business continuity or business resiliency. But actually feel like, hey, I've, I've gone through practice, right? I've actually tested this in a, in a real simulation and I can see what works and doesn't work and then that can give me feedback for what do I do next time. Um, so a couple of, uh, uh things available to you. I talk way too fast, a couple of things available to you, um, if you're interested in doing that recovery assessment, um, if you're interested in learning about the recovery range, or of course you know how to access us in the AWS marketplace, here are some opportunities for you. So that's my, uh, that's my quick overview, um. If anybody has uh questions, I'm gonna head over to my booth which is just right behind us over there. Happy to talk more about it and uh thanks for listening everybody, appreciate it.
