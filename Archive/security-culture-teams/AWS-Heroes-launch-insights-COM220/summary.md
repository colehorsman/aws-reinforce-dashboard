## Summary

This lively session features AWS Heroes sharing their real-time takeaways from the re:Inforce 2025 keynote, emphasizing the theme of **simplicity** across AWS announcements. While new features were introduced, the panelists highlight how AWS is reducing friction in onboarding, security implementation, and infrastructure management. They discuss the increasing complexity of cloud environments and the need for improved visualization, automation, and developer-centric tooling. The talk touches on controversial guidance (such as using wide IAM permissions initially), the rise of AI-assisted development and its risks, malware and supply chain threats, and the future of agent security in generative AI ecosystems.

## Key Points

- **Theme of the keynote** was clear: **simplicity and improved UX**, especially for services like CloudFront, AWS WAF, and Security Hub.
- Panelists strongly **disagree with starting with wide IAM permissions** and trimming later — Access Analyzer is helpful, but not a full safety net.
- There’s a growing challenge of **keeping up with AWS services** — many devs and security teams feel overwhelmed.
- AWS is making strides in **centralized threat visibility** — Security Hub previews now allow ticket creation and show cross-service attack correlations in one place.
- **GuardDuty Malware Protection for S3** and **GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring** were highlighted as important new security capabilities.
- Discussion on **AI agents and Bedrock Guardrails**: While promising, they pose new risks (e.g., agent chaining, unintended side effects, denial-of-wallet attacks).
- Warnings about **MCP (Model Customization Pack)** and potential **MCP spoofing risks** — compared to USB-C: convenient but potentially dangerous.
- Call for future AWS tools like “**GuardDuty for agents**” to address the rise of LLM-integrated applications.
- Emphasis on the **importance of secure software supply chains** — package impersonation and typosquatting in open-source are real threats.
- Simplicity in tooling is essential to keep up with **AI-driven development, vibe coding**, and rapid iteration cycles.

## Technical Details

- **Security Recommendations**:
  - Avoid wide-open IAM permissions in any environment, even during testing.
  - Use Access Analyzer for refinement, not initial trust.
  - Apply defense-in-depth: combine IAM, runtime, and data-layer monitoring.

- **Highlighted Services**:
  - **GuardDuty for EKS** and **Malware Protection for S3** for runtime and file security.
  - **Security Hub’s centralized ticketing preview**, integrating findings across GuardDuty, Macie, Detective, etc.
  - **Bedrock Guardrails** should be enabled for LLMs **and** their agents.

- **Threat Models Discussed**:
  - Denial-of-wallet via AI misuse (LLMs serving unintended users).
  - Chain-of-agent attacks and unsafe agent integrations (e.g., Slack → Jira).
  - MCP spoofing: installing malicious models or model interfaces.
  - Software supply chain compromise via package name hijacking (npm, PyPI, etc.).

- **Emerging Needs**:
  - “**Macy or GuardDuty for agents**” — automated monitoring of LLM agent behavior and integrations.
  - Better developer safeguards for AI apps: rate limiting, identity verification, malicious input handling.

- **Cultural Insight**:
  - “**Vibe coding**” (quick prototyping with AI-generated code) is rising, but opens the door to critical security oversights.
  - AWS’s simplification push aims to reduce operational debt created by this trend.

## Full Transcript

Welcome everybody. So we're uh. 22, 2 out of 3 of us are Brians, so from, from the Boston area. So like a Brian sandwich now hero sandwich overall. Uh, so we're basically giving you our, our sort of immediate reaction, uh, to the, to the keynote, and we were talking just a little bit a couple of minutes ago about, you know, what did we, what did we feel like was going on with the keynote and there were definitely new services. And capabilities announced, but it felt more like in general it was simplification, you know, trying to make you know an onboarding experience easier, making it because security is complicated and as someone who's used cloud front um and I designed my cloud front system and then I never wanted to touch it again because it was fine and I wasn't sure I wasn't gonna just break it anything that can make a cloud front simpler uh is awesome and. I loved the cloud front experience and I was getting in my use case like 99% hit rates so it was wonderful, but. I can't pretend that I could replicate it. Same, same. OK. Yeah, as a security hero actually these are really, really good features for me because we have lots of clients that are using the AWSF and the cloud front and they don't know what can you do like uh as you Brian said, as Brian said, there are lots of different cool managed rule sets that you want to enable in the AWSF. There are lots of to do for the class. Like attaching a V and attaching an ACM certificate on it, so it's really, really important to know, important to add some stuff because when you lost something you can broke everything for your production environment. So, uh, our words for today is simplicity for the keynote because the team has worked on the simplify and visual visualization. For everything like AWSF cloud front and for the maybe the security hub part because there are lots of threads uh that we need to find out and it's uh all of them in just one place for a centralized uh centralized situation actually. Yeah, I, I totally agree and um I, I do wanna get sort of a sense of where everybody's coming from. Yeah, just raise your hand if you build apps or you work on code for building applications. OK, cool. Um, nice, nice. Um, mainly do people do DevOps, so they're doing a lot of like cloud architecting, infrastructure. OK, cool, cool. Um, and then just security people. So is anybody here that just does security? OK, nice. I think that's like the three different groups. OK, cool, um, because, uh, personally as somebody that does a lot of software but then also needs to learn a lot of new things like a lot of new services and I just say like, oh I need to integrate, you know, waf or I need to integrate Shield. How do I do that? So I do a lot of that stuff with infrastructure's code, but it's really complicated and you might want to set it and then forget it and then you need to make a change and it becomes really hard. Say like how do I do this one thing? So I do like the approach of making things more simple. I just feel like there's a lot of very niche services that are important, but the scope to learn it is immense. It can be very challenging. So I really like the, the refining, making it easier, um, and I'm also just kind of curious, like, does anybody here feel like the pace of development is getting faster? Like you have to ship more? Of course a lot of head nods. OK, yeah, I feel similarly, I'm sure you all feel similarly. It's like, how do you keep up with all of these changes? So the, it, it needs to be more simple because it's, it's hard. How else can you scale without that? Right. 11 thing that the, the keynote speaker said that, that, and, and, and maybe this is, is, is bad, but at the very beginning she said something that I just strongly disagree with. So just, and, and you can disagree with me as as well but. I believe she said, start with broad permissions and then use Access Analyzer to restrict them. Uh, no, no, no, no, no, uh, I'm sorry, Amazon, but you know, no, um, you don't start with, with star as your permission and then say, oh, who got in, you know, who got in? Let's use Access Analyzer. I. Uh, I'm gonna say if you, if, if you heard the same thing that I, that, that I did, I would caution you, uh, not to follow that that approach. Start with, with, I mean. It's very hard to start with star and then restrict it because you say, well, I don't think anybody's using this. I'll restrict it and then you break something and you can say, oh no, no, Brian, I'm gonna use Access Analyzer and it's like, right, but Access Analyzer only tells you what was used during a particular period of time and maybe this other thing wasn't used during that time and so you restrict it. And then when it's needed it's not there and that is especially true for break glass situations you know there's all kinds of permissions you only you need during an emergency and when you're fighting an emergency, the last thing you as a security redemption person want is that you get blocked from doing a thing because Access Analyzer said you hardly ever used it. So I don't know, I'll stop ranting you guys can. No, I, I, I think that's valid. I, I do wonder if maybe there's like a case for if you're doing something local like local development testing, and then maybe it's kind of like you start with like the more broader access and then you refine it. I mean, you, we're definitely not doing that on proud like definitely we're not just like, oh, allow everything, but I wonder if that was it, cause I, I feel like sometimes you sort of want to get like, um, I don't know if does anybody use CDK or terraform? Oh my God, I hope so. I was gonna say, like, sometimes it's hard where like you, you have it like working and then it's like, er, like this isn't working, like reject, roll back, enabled. So then it's kind of like, well, what was the thing that caused that issue. So sometimes it's like I need to. To make the deployment work, and then you sort of like go back and make it more permissive. So I don't know if that was the like what she was trying to say, was just like you start kind of broad, get it like deployed, and then you, you sort of scope. But, but you're right, like using it. I don't know if you want to be testing it live, you know, maybe there was nuance to her statement, but saying start wide open. No, no, no, as a security person you should never do this because the time is never coming for the yes, we need to restrict this if you give some administration permission for your prod. Maybe it's like a month. It's still there because they don't want to. The developer team does not broke anything so they can just move on and someone is get get into there with with this, I don't know the hard coded keys or the IM user or the role and uh it's time to restrict some stuff before it's some. bad happens all the time whenever I see some administrator access uh like star and star and star, I was very curious about the environment because the clients and the AWS users are always say we have done this way for as you say like building some terraform or CDK. Scripts, but after that we forgot forgot getting some athletes privilege, and it can be a nightmare for the security engineers and for the users 100% and I want to make a shout out to Brian is doing a talk on um on vibe coding. As as a consulting partner, I worked for Cland um. I love the notion of vibe coding because it's gonna create so many disasters that they're gonna have to hire us to fix. So, um, so please vibe code, write terrible code, throw it to production immediately, have disasters, but don't go out of business because we want you still to have enough money to hire us, and that's not the certainly not our uh uh public line. uh, so let me just, you didn't hear me say any any of that. But with people doing vibe coding and accelerating even faster, security simplification is even more important because we have this culture of agents. It's all so easy. I'm just gonna have the AI write my code. It's fine. Well, that's fine for demoware, but the chasm from from vibe coding demo to production is enormous and anything Amazon can do to simplify that is to the good. Yes. So building off of that, this is a safe space, so we can be honest, like, has anyone ever tried any of those like generative AI code builders? Like I have, I'll put my hand up. Anybody, yeah, OK, we got some honest people in the room. So like, it's fascinating because it can help you bootstrap a project really quickly and it can work, you know, to a certain extent. Um, but what's really interesting is there's so many things that these abstract away. There's, there's just a lot of complexity to build a real system. So in my talk, I kind of talk about I made a Talk with documents app and then you sort of want to have, you know, streaming enabled so that it looks like, you know, your LLM app of choice. Um, you wanna do like talk with your document. It's using vector embeddings and all that cool stuff. But then what if you don't. rate limits. What if you don't know what a rate limit is? What if you have like, um, and actually I learned about this in your talk last year at reinforce, so like denial of wallet attacks. Yes, but how, um, so Brian gave a really great talk on this, um, it reinforced last year, yeah. And, um, because you give a lot of talks. I like sometimes forget like where they are. Um, but that was on that and it's really interesting because like I, I have clients where like they always be like, oh I have this AI thing. It it's working. And I'm like, OK, so like, do you know who's sending those requests? How often can they send those requests? Could they just use you as their LLM app replacement? Because now they're gonna run up your whole bill and they're gonna be getting a great product out of it because it's the same LLM under the hood. So there's a lot of these problems. Also, um, going back to the keynote, the guard duty um protection services for EKS. So, um, there's a great service we were actually talking about this right. For there's um guard duty malware protection for S3. So that's a really great service if you upload files to an S3 bucket and you want to know like is there malware in there? Is there gonna be like some virus where, and this gets really crazy because I built a social media platform that got acquired about a year and a half ago and what was really interesting was like if you send like a file and other people can access that file, I think images, think videos, think gifts if that's. Laced with something that's bad and people can download that to their browser. Well, now one person sees it, 10 people see it, 100 people see it, people reshare it. That's how like problems can come up. So when that came out last year it was really fascinating to see how you can implement security, not it's, it's, it's kind of complicated. It's not like a walk in the park, but to be able to implement that into your pipeline is huge because now you just have like all these security workers around the hood and. I don't know how long it would take you to actually build like a guard duty type service from scratch. Like it would be almost impossible for someone like me at least. I know you're a security expert so you could probably blast it out in like a day, but for me. I might not even get it correct. Well, it's but it's not just, it's not just the code, it's it's the, it's the ML-based knowledge base of all the the security things exactly. The other thing that's that's kind of interesting that wasn't touched on so much is the whole bedrock agentic experience and You know we did they did talk about a little bit about bedrock guard rails and oh my God turn them on, turn them on for your LLM but also turn them on for your agents um. I gave a talk yesterday on agentic security and we tend to think just like vibe coding, oh, it's awesome, agents, oh it's awesome, now I don't have to worry about anything and it's, it's the exact opposite. Um, and I, I threw out a use case yesterday that I'll throw out now you have an LLM and you've got guardrails, awesome and it talks to an agent and you've put the guardrails on the agent. Awesome. And one of the things you have an agent, um, that can talk to, uh, to Slack, well, that's great, you know, something happens you can post a message in Slack. That's so great. Then someone in your, in your company adds an integration to Slack so that Slack can talk to Jira. Well, that's awesome. What tickets do I have open? That's awesome. But then somebody says it's, it's getting to the end of the, my sprint and um I, all my, all my tickets aren't done yet, can you help me out? And the agent says, well, I just sent a message through Slack to Jira to close all your tickets. And you're like, uh, that wasn't what I expected, but it happened that integration happened without you knowing it necessarily, and you didn't therefore plan it. You don't have guardrails, you don't have test cases, um, and then you say, oh, I didn't want you to close all my tickets, reopen them, and the MLM says, or the agent says, no problem, I've reopened every ticket in your juror system. Uh, no, please reset it. No problem. I've I've reinitialized your Jira to ground zero, so there's these steps after step after steps, and I just, I, I will predict it. I'll make a bold prediction that by reinvent we have, uh, Macy for agents, you know, or, or Macy guard duty for agents or something like that. You heard it here first. Probably not, probably not, but watch it actually happen and then you're gonna be like, he can tell the future. That's why you're here because you want the insights. You want to see the future forward looking insights. So that's why you came to this session. If I could really tell the future, I'd be uh uh retired in the Caribbean. Uh, when we talk about the tickets and slack that you are saying, there is a preview about the AWS Security hub, and I am so excited about the creating tickets part because if there is a threat, we know there are lots of threats in everywhere like AWS detective, Macy, guard duty, we have a CSPM site in the AWS Security hub, but It's the end of the day that are like separate, but now we are seeing all the threats, all the E2 instances in just one place for like threat actor, yes, this is the IP, this is the issue, and we can create a ticket. And after that, maybe as you are saying, your agent closed that tickets and it can be a nightmare for us, but For the AWS side we are in a good mood because we can't create tickets with the AWS securet. It's only previ mode right now, right? But it's, it will be in general available at some point, and I'm really, really excited about to use it. How can we use them? How can we implement them in our lots of different AWS accounts actually. Absolutely and one of the things they talked about, and I have to check my own notes to figure out what service it was, but one of the services was looking for attack patterns. So we see, OK, so we see, you know, increased, uh, calls to this service and then increased calls to this service, um, again, since most agents are running in LLMs I expect to see some more focus there because if, if, if an LLM, uh. If if an a agentic lambda is being called out of out of your expected uh resource base, you wanna know about that and so I think, I think that that looking for patterns because because the bad guys are getting better they're getting, they're getting um more, more sophisticated and I think we're gonna see a lot of attack vectors coming through MCP um because remember the S in MCP stands for security. There is no SNMCP, um, so I, I, and, and, and if I was if I was wanting to write, um, red red team code, um, I would write an awesome MCP server that did something, uh, simple and useful. And then embed some bad stuff in it, and I could absolutely embed it so that someone just cursorly looking at the source code wouldn't wouldn't see it. I mean, it's, it's, would you, I'll keep asking, would you install a Python package into your system without doing due diligence? And unfortunately the answer is most of you probably would, most of us probably have and MCP servers are the same thing. So I expect that's the direction we're going to see Amazon going in. Yeah, and it's so interesting because I come from the JavaScript where I do a lot of Python stuff now, but my introduction to software engineering was like JavaScript. So you do like MPM install something if you're building a React app. So it's kind of interesting because like you might think that you have the right name of a package and then you install it, but it's actually the wrong package and actually could be something that has like malicious software in it or something like that also, um. It's very easy. There's, um, I don't know it's like it's very easy, but there's a lot of these cases where you have like open source packages. Some someone is able to get access to update something that now has malware in it, and then now you install that. Now that's that's in your root application. Now that's powering what your users are going to see that goes to production, and now your users are using bad stuff. So I, I do wonder if there will be that, um, attack vector where it can be like. MCP spoofing or like MCPs that look like a real thing and then you're like oh that could be like something cool like I want this but it's like actually bad you know and and the hype cycles you know I see that on social media like oh like check out this cool thing something starts trending like oh I wanna try it out then you don't do that due diligence that you said like we all need to do it's really easy to just like fall into the hype cycle. So I feel like it's simplicity and also refocusing. Because it's like as as exciting as a lot of this tech is, you gotta make sure you're doing the right stuff because if you don't like it's very easy to like FOMO into something else and not check yourself, right? And, and one of the one of the descriptions of MCP was that it's, it's a standardized interface and so they said people were saying think about it like USB-C it's a universal, you know, interface we can all, we don't need to carry the octopus of, of different types of cables. It's all just MCP like. In and then the FBI comes out and says, oh, if you're at an airport, don't plug in your don't plug in your USB-C into any old public thing because God knows what it could be doing. It's like, right, MCP really is like USB. Be very, very careful about what you're using, um, yeah. Uh, I think we are out of time. All I can say is, uh, I am very, I'm so excited about this cool feature about the simplicity and as we said, the visibility all of everything, even if you have using GII and CPS, we, I, I, I am really trying to learn about everything, every new insights, uh, from the reinforce. And I think thanks for everything and uh thank you all for listening to us. I will be around here and. Right, we're, we're all AWS we're all AWS heroes, which means we talk a lot, um, you know, my, my, my wife says that the most dangerous place in the world is to stand between me and a microphone. She's not wrong, but we'll be around and we're happy to chat with any of y'all. And thanks so much for attending, everybody. Thank you so much for listening.
