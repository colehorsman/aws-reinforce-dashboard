Thank you so much. Hi everyone, I'm Rinki. I'm the chief security officer at Upwind Security, um, and it's my honor to have, uh, Lucas Moody here, um, who is the chief information security officer at All Tricks and a very happy customer of Upwind, of course. Well, before we get into to more round up when Lucas, I thought it would be really interesting for you to share a little bit about your career journey and kind of what you've seen in terms of transformations, whether it's cloud or AI and kind of where you, what you're seeing today. Yeah, happy to, uh, and thank you. It's, it's funny because I'm in the presence of like internet royalty and she's asking me the questions. I should be asking her, but Um, to give you a sense of my career, my name's Lucas. I'm the SVP CIO at Altrix. Uh, it's a company in data analytics. I've been here for like 3 years, but I've been in cyber for 26. So, uh, that means I started my career in cyber, uh, back before Y2K. Um, and so I started my career at Oracle. I was actually in product engineering, uh, quickly transitioned into cyber more opportunistically. Uh, we didn't really have a cyber function. It was more kind of a a subfunction of Ege, and, uh, one of our DNS servers were attacked, and so I spent some time recovering that and I'm like, dude, this is. Cool. This is some fun stuff, and I never really looked back. And so I was at Oracle for about 7 years. This is the point at which Oracle decided to move me to Austin, Texas, spent a few years out there, and then I finally decided to bring it back to California, which is where I started, and I joined KPMG. And so at KPMG, it was a really interesting time. Cyber was becoming more of a real function. Uh, and so, um, I, I decided to go to the dark side, go into consulting and actually help a bunch of companies build their programs. Uh, and so I was really lucky. I had customers like Salesforce.com, eBay, PayPal, Apple, Verisign, Yahoo. I mean, just an amazing bunch of companies decided after a few years of doing that, that I was going to join one of them, so I went to eBay, PayPal. And that's where I think a lot of the fun began because eBay. PayPal at the time, uh, eBay, PayPal actually pushed more bandwidth online than any other company. This was pre-Amazon, pre all the Amazon was around, but it was very early days. And so, um, so yeah, we got to see some really cool and interesting stuff. We got to battle some really cool and interesting bad guys and so I really cut my teeth in ops in a more profound way there, uh, for another, I think it was 6 years that I was there. Uh, and then from there I jumped to a company called Intuit. Uh, Intuit's, uh, TurboTax Mint.com if you're not familiar, uh, and got to do some really cool things. Actually Rinky and I were there together. Um, we got to to battle, uh, fraudsters that were stealing identities online. We got to support this, you know, this on-prem to cloud transformation, uh, because back in those days, you would actually go to Costco and buy a TurboTax CD. To file your taxes, um, and so old school, uh, but in either case, from there I jumped to probably the most profound role that I ever had, or at least this this transformed me and my career. Um, there was a little old company called Palo Alto Networks. Uh, they'd just gone public. They're about half a billion revenue company, and they were looking for their first CISO. Uh, and, um, I ended up meeting them at their EBC and they're like, Well, Lucas, would you be interested in coming on board? Uh, and so I was lucky enough to join Paolo as their first CIO, once again, playing bodyguard for a company that is a bodyguard for the web, not unlike Upwind is today. Uh, and so anyway, from there I went to, um, Rubric, Twitter, uh, and then where I'm at today at AlterX, uh, which is a data analytics company. We were taken private about a year ago, but I've enjoyed every moment of my journey. In addition to being an operator, um, I'm also an investor, investing in a lot of cyber companies, uh, so I've just been blessed with this amazing journey, but I will hand back to you. Yeah, in addition to doing the CISO job again and again and again, you're also an active investor and adviser at Lockstep. You're seeing um innovation every day talking to hundreds of companies, um, and then you're talking to practitioners. Like, what are the top three trends that you're excited about, um, or, or that scare you, but more on the innovation side that are that you're excited about that folks are finally adopting. I mean, there's so much to be excited about right now. Um, obviously, and this goes without saying, and all of you have heard this a million times, but I'll, I'll say it, I guess one more time. Uh, the, the, the AI revolution is real and we're seeing it in many different ways. We we're seeing it. Uh, from the lens of kind of being on the receiving end of, of, you know, new and novel attacks, we're, we're investing in both Rinky and I are investing in categories that are being upended by AI and so companies that are solving for old school security problems with the benefit of having AI as wind in their sails. And then of course we're all having to kind of duck. And maneuver around this idea of we need to enable our developers. We need to enable our product teams. We need to enable our workforce with modern tools, tech, but we need to do it in a guard railed way. We need to do it in a risk managed way. And so how do we do that? I think the jury is still out in a lot of those categories, but I think there's there's a couple verticals that I think are ripe for AI and AI disruption. Um, trust and safety, for example, fraud, uh, we're, we're seeing a lot of benefit with AI ops, um, Ricky and I actually looked at a lot of company in the ops, kind of the agentic security ops space for many years, or for, for many months I should say, um, and it was kind of, you know, we kind of paused, we were waiting to jump in, but it's looking very exciting today. So there's a number of categories like that. Um, identity and data and the convergence of the two, is really interesting. Uh, and then of course runtime, which is what we're here to talk about. Um, uh, what, what, um, what Upwind is doing with runtime in cloud, um, is also another exciting category that I think is very investable and, uh, we're seeing a lot of companies, uh, take advantage, so. Yeah, like, talk a little bit more about runtime, right? Because I think um You're one of the CISOs that that has adopted that philosophy kind of earlier on, um, and it's kind of a new term that's come out like how hard, how easy was it for you to kind of like do that run that transformation and bring in new technology at all tricks. Well, I mean, it's like any time there's a novel way to solve an old problem, uh, there's a little bit of selling that has to happen, uh, not just selling to the CISOs, but the CISOs selling to their respective business. And so, um, I think, I mean, there's there's always that, right? But I, but the. I think on the, on the plus side, I think the storyline makes a lot of sense to people, which is, if you, if you think about it, this is how I sold it. If you think about it, like deterministic systems are pretty easy to secure with planning upfront. You architect the right stuff and you build for it like. SPM for example, and I think that's a great first start, but I think most problems are solved in runtime. Uh, if you look historically at any sort of, uh, you know, business or any sort of like thing that's evolved over time, you start with building it up front, planning it, architecting it appropriately and getting really good at your tooling. Uh, but you get the best benefits. Like if you look at like Formula One, for example, they built all these cars. It was all in the front and it was all about the strength you can build into these cars. But really where you started to see like step order improvement is when they started building sensors into all the cars while they were driving, and that's where you get all the signals that enabled you to get to the right outcomes. And so that's the way I think about it, and that's the way we, we sold it. And of course, engineering hopped on board because we're now a customer, so. I love that and I I love the analogy to F1. I think we're gonna definitely use that and steal it up with steal it, yeah. Um, last question for you, um, as we're, uh, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of aspiring leaders here, a lot of aspiring CISOs, people that are going through transformations, um, you've gone through kind of AI transformation, cloud transformation, going through probably. As we speak as well, um, what's advice like on how you handle that kind of transformation from a security perspective? How do you plug in and build the right partnerships with other executives? How do you talk about this from a security lens with the board? Yeah, OK, that's, there's a lot of parts to that. So at the, uh, I think on the upfront, um, I mean security like any other organization. Uh, has a responsibility of engaging with and inspiring slash influencing organizations that need to do the, the hard work on, on security, right? Security organizations can, you know, throw problems over the wall, can go and call out what what you need to start building, can, uh, set, set requirements for your engineering teams and whatnot, but I think ultimately, uh, the ability to influence is key. And so I think that's where I've always started, um, as a CISO going all the way back to my first CISO role at Pallo. Uh, it was very much engaging with engineering, engaging with product, engaging with IT, the three core constituents or the, the, the trinity, if you will, of organizations that need influence from security, uh, and then building relationships, um, and then two, it's, it's building context. A lot of these organizations have good intent. They want to get to the right outcomes, but. Um, sometimes getting to those outcomes, uh, requires a meandering path that are very expensive. Uh, and these organizations have other things that they didn't need to deliver on. So it's really around building context on risk, helping them to understand the why, uh, and then of course painting the picture, uh, and building the narrative on what happens when you do this incorrectly. Um, and so with a, with a company like Paolo, it was a little bit easier because I think inherently they understood that. Uh, that security or a security breach in our case would have been an existential risk to the company because who wants to buy a security product from a company that that goes through something major like that. Um, and so it was easier there. It's a lot harder when you're at an organization where you've got to kind of paint the picture in a two layers abstracted kind of way. So thinking about all tricks, for example, we're a data analytics shop, so it makes sense that we build in security, but oftentimes we've really got to tell the story on what our customers or those that we're selling into are going to demand of us. And so that's why I think the ecosystem is a very powerful engine to drive like some of the. ways that we, we, you know, convince others and others on on outcomes. So and I didn't touch on your board stuff, but go ahead. No, no, I lied. I said last question because I misread the timer, so I'm going to put you on the spot, yeah, yeah, but with the board 10 no, so at the board level is completely different. So I've now had to present. Um, to, I think I've had 5 boards that I, I was, uh, that I kind of dotted line reported to, starting with, uh, Intuit, and then Paolo, and then Rubric, Twitter, and now at AlterX. Um, it's a very complicated endeavor. I think, uh, different boards are made up of, uh, of different talent, different energy, different kind of backdrops, different experiences and such. At Palo, we had a board that was very like VC heavy. Uh, and being VC heavy, you'll know VCs are not the most technical folks in the world, but I mean they're pretty technical. So we had a very technical board that was very deep on security with security investors. So those boardrooms were pretty complicated. Um, I spent a lot of time building relationships and I spent a lot of time really understanding what was meaningful to them before those meetings, right? Um, and so. So I wouldn't be ambushed in the boardroom because that's one of the worst feelings in the world. It's happened to me many times. Uh, and then going like to Altricks, it's really at Altrick my engagement with the board is much more of an educational set of sessions. It's really kind of teaching what's important, helping to understand the context on investment, um, helping them to understand the things that we're not investing in yet and why that's. OK, um, all those things I think are meaningful. So hopefully that answers your question. No, that's, that's super helpful um and you know, like on that, a lot of times asISOs folks think that it's the hardest thing to manage the board or other executives, but a lot of times when we're going through like AI transformation or even when I think about runtime and I went through this myself. Your team thinks you've heard a new buzzword and then you're like trying to tell them to think about it and sometimes you're like actually when you're going through a cloud security transformation or you're thinking about something differently, you have to manage the team in a particular way and kind of upskill and do different things there and we're kind of going through that too right now right with people kind of feeling threatened by AI as well. But when you're thinking about these new ways of driving, whether it's like runtime security or it's AI transformation, like how do you manage that with the team? It's a great question. Um, I think, first of all, this whole AI is gonna take my job thing, I think is a, is an absolute joke. Uh, AI can barely do anything well. I mean, I was, um, I, I, this, the, the whole AI is gonna take our job. Let's set that to the side for a minute. In terms of like bringing teams along, I think you're right, it's hard because oftentimes what we're we're doing our best to do as as practitioners and executives in the security space, is we're trying to look around corners to some degree, right? We're not, I mean, we all have to invest in what's happening right this second, but we all have to also forward invest in where we think the markets are going. Um, and that's, that's the hard part. And so how do we sell the team on investments where it's oftentimes upstarts that are solving for it and you know, the products don't seem well baked, it's more vision than it is engineering and all the rest. Um, and so I think it's about helping them to one understand like it's, it's not unlike selling on the board, right? It's, um, the board's a non-technical body. You've got a technical body, but they're kind of rooted in today and not tomorrow. So it's helping them to see why you're thinking that this is something that's going to come around the corner. For example, I don't know, like AI and AI enabling, kind of, you know, reducing the barriers of entry for bad guys to come in and attack companies, for example. It's reducing, you know, it's like old school script kitties are now powerful, you know. Teams of like agentic attackers, if you will, um, and so I think it's around just helping, helping to build that context, helping them to see what it might look like if you lose that, that, that, you know, the, the, the, the Cold War on the weapons, you know, the, the nuclear proliferation, that type of thing. I love it. OK, and you know, one of the questions I've been dying to ask you is like as you're looking at Founders and new tech, I mean, you're a really early customer of Upwind and there, you know, something gave you confidence and we'll get to Upin in a second, but what do you look for in early founders and companies where you're like, you know what, I wanna work with them. In founders or the or the product and the product and like just thinking about Altris at one point was a public company and it's it's taking a risk when you're going with a really early cyber company and so kind of what draws you, how do you make the decisions to partner with early stage companies. Yeah, um, so I, I, the investments I usually make are left of a, so usually precede seed and a precede seed, it's like. 99.9% founder conviction. It's, you know, it's the quality of the founding team. It's their ability to execute their attention to detail, their ability to engineer, their ability to inspire, their ability to storytell, their, you know, their ability to hire great people and that type of thing. I mean, that's really early on, that's what you're looking for. Then you can kind of help shape where the product goes. Um, I think that was my early draw to up when it was really this this founding team. The team that assembled around them, um, obviously you're joining now, uh, but this team's been around for some time. And so really understanding the vision, knowing we're looking around corners, we knew like it's like any other, any other, um, any other kind of industry vertical that transforms. You start with staging up front. You start with really good planning. You start with in in cloud the concept of CSPM, right? Getting posture really good on the upfront. Well, that evolves into run time. And so we knew that was coming. Looking at a number of companies that we're solving for and we believed in this team, and we ended up being right because the team is going gangbusters at this stage. So does that, did I answer all of it? Yeah, yeah, exactly. And are there any barriers you have to come across, like, you know, as you're bringing in early stage companies into all tricks, like as a customer, how do you get through kind of like the barriers through the legal process compliance process as you're becoming a customer? Oh, you all know this because I think there's a lot of go to market folks here, right? We like you raise your hands. How many go to market folks we got. But barely any. All right. Um, OK, well, you guys know, I mean, um, uh, for us, any, any kind of early stager, um, if you wanna do like early stage POCs and things like that, it's really tough to get across the line because there's a lot of security requirements and not. Uh, you know, these early upstarts are not always solving for, you know, selling in a large enterprise first. And so what I like to do is I partner with these organizations and help them build that, um, when we're doing like early POCs, we'll do an early POC in a segmented off or a scoped environment where we're OK doing that, uh, and then really help them uplift their security programs and it's, it's kind of a, uh, it's a win-win. It's, it's what we do in support of one another in this industry, right? If I'm selling into like a large financial, for example, they set a bunch of requirements on me. A lot of folks think that that's a bad thing. I love it because it helps me to uplift my security program and helps me get budget. It helps me hire and do all those other things, and I think we, we try to do those same things for for startups. Now it's a little different, of course, because startups, most of their money is gonna be going into engineering and product, but I mean that's the type of partnership that I look for in a an early startup is somebody that's gonna lean in and do that for me, um, and so does that. Yeah, does that cover? That's awesome. And uh uh some on parting thoughts here, like one thing we care about a lot at Upwind, which is one of the reasons I just joined a few months ago is kind of their investment in people where people first business. We believe strongly in the community, um, and I know that community now is like, you know. Especially after the pandemic, folks are coming back together, give me your thoughts on the community and like why it's so important to invest in the community and um I know you're a big believer in that as well, and that's why we come to these conferences, of course, to learn about the tech but to build relationships with others as well. Yeah, uh, for sure, yeah, community is everything so um. I think for me, you know, I, I mentioned in my opening remarks. I've been in this business 26 years. I've made a lot of friends in those years, and those friends are very important in many different ways. Obviously, uh, for us to bounce ideas off of if I haven't seen something, friends in the business probably have, uh, and that's a force multiplier for, for security practitioners. Practitioners that live in a silo, um, really have a hard time executing on their jobs, in my opinion. But it goes beyond that because, um, as we're thinking about, for example, like investing, um. I've got my lens on the world. I have an idea and I have a thought process around what I think is going to be really important, but I represent like a little mini sliver of the world, and oftentimes the problems that I'm seeing aren't the problems that everybody else is seeing. So I think we, we have this collective voice that starts to come out when we build around community. And so I've been doing that for some time. Um, and, uh, and for me, it's really important to get out and, and connect with the community. Events like this, like Rinky and I host stuff all the time and so yeah, all those things are very important to me. Thank you so much. Again, it was an honor. Um, Lucas is our, again, for those of you that came to us. He's a customer of Upwind. He's CISO at all tricks. I'm the CIO at um Upwind. I just joined, was a former customer at Bill. I, I know we have to wrap up here, but we're gonna be around, so come chat with us about Upwind, about runtime, anything. So thank you very much. Yeah, we'd love to talk. Thank you.
