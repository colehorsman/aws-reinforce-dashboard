## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session (SEC224) presents a behavioral and leadership-focused discussion on building diverse and inclusive security teams to achieve better security outcomes. Delivered by an AWS security leader with over 25 years of experience (including nearly 30 years as a female in security), the presentation emphasizes how diversity directly impacts team effectiveness, problem-solving velocity, and threat detection capabilities.

The session challenges traditional hiring and team-building approaches by demonstrating how homogeneous teams create blind spots that threat actors can exploit. With over 30% of cybercriminals now being female, the speaker argues that security teams must reflect diverse perspectives to effectively understand and counter varied attack methodologies. The presentation moves beyond demographic diversity to explore cognitive diversity, neurodiversity, and diverse professional backgrounds as strategic advantages in security operations.

Key emphasis is placed on the concept that leaders create inclusive environments rather than people having inherent disabilities. The speaker advocates for adjusting leadership styles and operational practices to leverage different thinking patterns, communication preferences, and problem-solving approaches as strengths rather than obstacles. The session provides practical frameworks for recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent while establishing inclusive team cultures that enable all members to contribute their unique perspectives and capabilities effectively.

## Key Points
- Security teams need diverse perspectives to understand and counter increasingly diverse threat actors (30%+ of cybercriminals are female)
- Homogeneous teams create blind spots that attackers can exploit through different methodologies and approaches
- Diversity encompasses demographics, cognitive differences, neurodiversity, professional backgrounds, and educational experiences
- Leaders must adjust their communication and management styles to leverage different thinking patterns and strengths
- Diverse teams demonstrate increased velocity in problem-solving and incident response due to varied perspectives
- Inclusive environments reduce workplace stress and increase employee satisfaction and retention
- Traditional recruiting methods often perpetuate homogeneity by targeting similar sources and experiences
- Job descriptions may inadvertently discourage diverse candidates (women often require 100% qualification match vs. men applying with partial matches)
- AWS incident response teams deliberately hire from diverse backgrounds including law enforcement and data science
- Clear communication protocols must accommodate different preferred communication styles (verbal vs. written, synchronous vs. asynchronous)

## Technical Details
- **Neurodiversity Integration**: Accommodation strategies including advance document sharing, font considerations, and meeting agendas for ADHD and dyslexia
- **Communication Protocols**: Multiple channels including video calls, Slack channels, and one-on-one meetings to accommodate different communication preferences
- **Recruiting Strategies**: Partnerships with diverse professional organizations, universities, and specialized hiring events for underrepresented communities
- **Team Composition**: AWS teams include members with law enforcement backgrounds, data science expertise, and varied technical specializations
- **Incident Response Enhancement**: Diverse teams show improved velocity in threat detection and resolution due to varied analytical approaches
- **Leadership Development**: Training programs for managers to understand and leverage cognitive diversity and neurodiversity
- **Tool Accessibility**: Ensuring security tools and resources are accessible across different cognitive and physical capabilities
- **Project Leadership**: Equal opportunity distribution across team members regardless of experience level, background, or communication style
- **Development Programs**: Mentorship and cross-training initiatives specifically designed for underrepresented team members
- **Cultural Integration**: Incorporation of diversity and inclusion principles into team culture and operational procedures
- **Assessment Frameworks**: Methods for evaluating team diversity across multiple dimensions beyond traditional demographic categories
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging different thinking patterns and problem-solving approaches as strategic advantages in security operations

Wow, hello. Yeah. I recognize some of you from a previous session, so I'm glad you're here again um I was just saying I'm I'm talking about kind of a behavioral topic at a technology event and I hope that you're all like me and you're technology leaders, most of the security leaders that care very much about the teams you're building and how you're building them to provide the most business advantage, security outcomes in your particular area of the business so today. Talking about inclusive security trying to talk really loud so hopefully you guys can hear me OK? um I know there's a few of you here, but can you raise your hand if you are a security leader in your organization? Are you leading a team today? I figure this is a yes, yes, raise it loud and proud. Um, so a little bit of background about me, I've been at AWS now for a little over 6.5 years. I do lead a security team for AWS, but prior to that I've led security teams for the majority of my career, so more than 25 years, proud to say female in security for almost 30 years, which is incredible. So I care very deeply about building the best world class team, and I'm gonna talk a little bit about the importance of diversity to unlock the potential in creating a more effective team environment. So today we're gonna talk through some general areas of diversity because if we talk about diversity at a really high level we're not really diving deep into what that actually means so I wanted to play some real world examples of ways we think about creating a diverse team. And then exploring the dimensions within those areas and then actually give you some actionable next steps. So how can you actually go out, go back into the world after this amazing event, evaluate your own team environment and start focusing on actionable next steps that you can take to make sure you have built a diverse team that you're actually leveraging the benefits of that diversity. Alright, so let's talk about some general areas of diversity, and I did get fun with some graphics to kind of tell the story along the way, but think about it in terms of the different demographic diversity areas like race, authenticity, gender, gender identity, age, um, sexual orientation, physical ability just. there's also other areas that we're gonna explore, but think about it from the perspective of the attackers, the the threat actors that are out there in the world and how differently they think than maybe what we think as security leaders and so from a global perspective from an uh from a regional perspective. It's about bringing diversity of thought in so that you can make higher velocity decisions as leaders, you can see patterns in a more recognizable way, and you can be more effective as a team. I do know that there's a rise as far as cyber criminals. Um, did you know that over 30% of them are female today? Like this is an interesting idea. Like how do you think about preventing threats in your incident response program or other security teams if your team all looks the same and thinks the same, right? We've got to bring diversity of thought and lived experience in so that we can be more effective. There's also differences in work experience and so when I was preparing for this talk, I actually did some interviewing of some of our internal teams, teams that focus specifically on incident response and I'm like how do you think about your hiring tactics? Like do you always look for a certain technical capability and the answer was no like our AWS incident response team, our customer incident response team. Is a peer organization to me and I interviewed them and like some of them have law enforcement backgrounds for example like some of them are data scientists like you've gotta be able to bring in diversity of skill set to actually build a robust team that doesn't think the same. So other ways that maybe you haven't thought of, but I definitely see this. Uh, this is very big on here, by the way. But think about other types of diversity like cognitive diversity. I actually attended my very first hiring event focused on neurodiversity, which I'm so excited about um think about the the the way that people think differently, how they see patterns, how they recognize patterns as a strength, some may say superpower. But thinking about things like um the percentage of American adults or adults worldwide that that do um have ADHD or dyslexia some of the other categorizations that may be neurodiverse versus neurotypical and um it's been such an eye opening experience for me personally to recognize how the difference in the way individuals think and how I. As a leader can adjust some of my own leadership style to accommodate and make the environment a much more inclusive and diverse environment to leverage those skills and strengths on my team not think of those as anyone with a disability because it's not what it is, right? We as people, leaders. Disable people if we don't create an inclusive and diverse environment and so that's a different way of thinking. Also thinking about educational background, uh, professional experience, thinking styles, problem solving approaches, and so, um. Like I said, leaders create the inclusive environment. Need to be educated on how to leverage those strengths and I I'm sharing quite vulnerably my own personal experience and I think the number one of the top things that we have to do as leaders is recognize where we need to learn ourselves right? if someone is thinking differently than we are, how do we learn to make the right adjustments to leverage those skills and abilities to to uh take advantage of that skill, OK. So, um, a security team. That values diversity. Values diversity and thoughts and ideas leading to innovation and what I really like about this too is that think about if you have everyone on your team that has similar lived experiences similar method of preferred method of communication, um, similar background right how many new ideas are gonna come to the table? And I will say one of the things that I do love about our Amazon leadership principles, we have a leadership principle called our right a lot. And some people think that means as a leader I need to be right a lot and that's not what it means it means how do you get to right? How do you get to having the right answer? How do you know if it's right and so when I think about testing your idea, getting diverse feedback, having people look at it that have different lived experience. Experiences than you or different technical backgrounds it's the way you get to what's right right so think about the role of diversity in that how do you know you're making the right decision? How do you know you're solving problems as fast as you can solve them if you're not looking at the issue or the pattern from a diverse perspective. And so experience has increased velocity and problem solving. I saw this as it related to the velocity how fast are you actually resolving incidents, because if your team culture is centered around diversity and communication and how you work together as a team, you're already primed to solve problems very quickly together so when an incident happens and things have to to happen very quickly, the team is already inclusive of that communication style. It also decreases workplace stress which I actually really love because you want to make sure that people that have diversity and thought they think differently than you, they have the safety that it takes to come to you and disagree with you or share a different perspective with you and they have to feel comfortable showing up as who they are, right? And so celebrating different aspects of diversity celebrating the fact that this person has a different lived experience than you they have a different background, but their voice is welcome that leads to better um to better overall employee experience and decreased workplace stress. Increasing employee satisfaction overall like it makes the team a really welcome place to work and those high performers on the team are gonna wanna stay because they feel welcome. They feel valued because of their diversity. So here's some actionable next steps. Now, first of all, I didn't put this on the slide, but I would say if you're not sure how you're doing as far as this is related, you have to take the action to educate yourself. Um, especially in, in some of the areas like neurodiversity that I mentioned earlier, I'm personally learning a lot. I'm learning to be the best leader that I can be to the neurodiverse employees on my team. I'm looking at ways that I can leverage the power that comes with the, the different way of thinking and leveraging that in the right way on my team, so it starts with education like everything else, but also um recruiting channels. If you're always recruiting from the same prior experience, if you're always recruiting through the same source, you're always gonna get the same candidates and I know specifically like looking at the male versus female percentage on my team, we did a deep dive and read the job descriptions and you know that a female candidate may not apply unless they meet 100% of the qualifications where a male may say oh. I meet most of these I'm gonna apply, so it's you have to make it a welcome environment and really look at those job descriptions and and how you're actually targeting that skill set. Partnering with diverse professional organizations and universities is a great idea like I like I mentioned um I attended my very first neurodiverse hiring event and it was about uh college graduates and cybersecurity identifying as neurodiverse like looking for career opportunities like this is the big change as far as what I've seen in my personal experience and I'm I'm celebrating it. I think if if someone is brave enough to say. I'm a part of the neo diverse community. Here's how I want to communicate. Here's what works for me. He's the value that I can add. I as a leader, want to, I want to welcome that. Again, focusing on varied skill sets and backgrounds. So establishing inclusive development programs, creating a mentorship opportunity um for the underrepresented team members I know in the Amazon environment we have amazing um groups that you can belong to so hopefully your organization has similar you can be an ally celebrate those areas of. Diversity and implement some cross training programs to share the knowledge like I mentioned um really diving into neurodiversity on my team personally having some training with all the leaders in my organization so that we understand um some key differentiating ways that we can make sure I'll give you an example if if you have an individual that has dyslexia on your team and you're gonna start off a meeting by reading a document. It's what we do at Amazon. Maybe it'd be a better idea to give that, give them the heads up and give them the document at least 10 minutes earlier, giving them time or or possibly it's thinking about what font is that document in. Like I said earlier, we as leaders. Or society in general we are the ones that disable people from from doing the things they need to do, right? It's not the other way around and so we've got to think about how we're creating a welcoming environment and celebrating diversity. So incorporating inclusion into your team culture develop clear communication protocols. The other thing that I think about as a leader is not everyone on the call or or the team meeting feels comfortable sharing by raising their hand and coming on camera like the. Best ideas might come from a Slack channel or a way that they can type or maybe having a one on one conversation. It doesn't mean that that person adds less value to the overall initiative. It just means that their preferred communication style may be different than yours, and you've got to celebrate and bring that diversity in. Ensure equal access to tools and resources like I said, the things that we do, the tools that we use, are they, um, are there gonna be advantageous people with dyslexia? um if the individual on your team has ADHD, how can you possibly change? Maybe you send an agenda before the meeting. That you know that adds a layer of comfort and brings them in to be a part of that meeting. It makes them feel valued when you as a leader are responding to what you know that they need and then giving all team members opportunity to lead projects again this is about celebrating whether they're early in career late in career different skill sets, different nationalities um different lived experiences all getting equal opportunity. All right, I think I'm gonna end a little bit early. I hope that this was uh beneficial to you and you think about how you are looking at your team, looking at the diversity both from a skill set, um, age orientation, um neurodiversity, all of those things important in your security teams. I wanted to mention also that we have um the culture of security lounge which is behind me. And uh these part of this topic and this track is all along the lines of culture of security. So yesterday I talked about psychological safety today talking about diversity we have so many of these behavioral style um talks and education that. We've been trying to give this year reinforce again taking the eye off the technology just a little bit and focusing on the people but if you wanna head over to our AWS culture of security um I'll be there to answer any questions and would love to connect with you.
