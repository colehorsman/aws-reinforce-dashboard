## Summary
This session was delivered by Amy, CTO and co-founder of Wiz, focusing on rethinking traditional approaches to cloud security. The presentation emphasizes that cloud security extends beyond just cloud objects (CSPM) to encompass everything built and running in the cloud, requiring a fundamental shift in security approaches.

The speaker identifies a critical disconnect between three key perspectives: the attacker view (which sees applications holistically), the developer view (which gets overwhelmed by multiple security tools and alerts), and the current security team structure (which is often fragmented into vertical silos). This misalignment results in ineffective security practices that don't scale with modern development speeds and cloud-native architectures.

The proposed solution involves moving towards a horizontal security model that spans across code, cloud, and runtime environments, making security more self-service oriented. This approach emphasizes proper asset ownership, context-aware problem routing, and breaking down traditional vertical security silos to create a more unified, effective security strategy that aligns with how both attackers and developers view applications.

## Key Points
- Cloud security needs to be viewed holistically, beyond just cloud-specific tools
- Attackers don't care about organizational structures; they see applications as a whole
- Current security tools and teams are too fragmented and vertically oriented
- Developers are overwhelmed by multiple security tools and disconnected alerts
- Security needs to bridge the gap between attacker perspective and developer needs
- Asset ownership is fundamental to effective security, similar to financial governance
- Traditional vertical security approaches (SCA, EDR, etc.) need to be reimagined horizontally
- Security teams should be structured around applications rather than security domains
- Self-service and automation are crucial for scaling security operations
- Security needs to be continuous across code, cloud, and runtime environments

## Technical Details
- Traditional security tools mentioned: CSPM, ASPM, DSPM, AISPM, KSPM, EDR, SCA, SAST, DAST
- Security scanning requirements: container images, vulnerabilities, secrets, data, APIs
- Need for continuous scanning across all environments (code, cloud, runtime)
- Asset ownership tracking and governance systems required
- Automated problem routing system with proper context
- Service catalog integration for security operations
- Horizontal security architecture spanning code, cloud, and runtime environments
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security
- Context-aware security alerts and remediation guidance
- Asset ownership mapping and tracking mechanisms

Great. So, um, I would love to actually make this as much of a conversation as possible, um, conversation about, um, like about cloud security, obviously, uh, but more it's bigger than cloud security, OK? It's a conversation about how we are supposed to do security, um, because fundamentally I think, and that's a lot of what we're trying to do, um, in ways is trying to rethink how security is done. And why is it so broken? And I honestly with more, more uh fun to make this a discussion, so feel free to actually just ask questions um and brainstorm and give me your thoughts and feedback, um, so, uh. I, I'm Amy, the CTO and co-founder of Wiz and Wiz is a cloud security company founded just 5 years ago, and, and our mission is to try and change the way security is done. That's, that's our goal, and we are a cloud security company, but to be honest. Cloud security in my view, it doesn't stop in uh just cloud objects, right? Cloud security is not about uh uh what we call CSPM OK? Cloud security is the security of the things that we build, right, because they run in the cloud so it covers basically everything you have in the cloud, which is everything, right? And so that's why I think the story here is not about cloud security, it's about how we do security uh now uh when I when I think that. Cloud specifically does change the way we do security. We, I, I, I think there's a few reasons so I wanna explain like why fundamentally I think things have changed but we didn't change the approach to security, right? So basically. Everything in cloud is agile, right? You, you have code and it and it ships to the cloud all the time. Everything is very dynamic, very connected, right? When I think about an application, right, where's the application actually? Where does it live? So it lives in the cloud, right? But it's also, it has an origin in the code, right? And it's getting built in the pipeline and it's continuous, right? And there are different teams that are responsible for different parts of this, but eventually it's if I think about an application. The application is the combination of all of those components together operating together like a orchestra right? but every part of this has maybe a different team that owns it and also maybe different security issues that can come from it but you have to think about this as one this is the application right now when we. When we think about the role of security, in my view, the role of security is to connect two different personas. On the one hand, the attacker, that is one persona, the attacker that wants to attack your application, right? This is the person that I need to understand how they're gonna operate, what they're gonna do. This is the what we call the attacker view the the attacker. They don't care about the different parts of our pipeline or the different teams we have in security, right? The attacker looks for attacks. That's what they do. So attacker, I call it the attacker doesn't care about the org structure, right? Why, why do I say that? Because many times security teams, they care about org structures, right? Many times even more than they. About other stuff they care about or structures but attackers don't care about work structures. It means that they try to look for an attack, right? Many times an attack would actually be combination of stuff that actually are across different teams in the security organization, OK, so think about it, the purpose of security is to be. One step ahead of the attacker, OK? So we need the attacker view and the attacker view is not based on different teams. The attacker sees the application as a whole. So who in the security organization sees the application as a whole? today no one because we don't have the attack review, right? So that's problem number one. We don't understand the real problems because we don't see the attack review. Now the other problem which is also very severe. Is there what are we supposed to do is insecurity in cloud. We have the attackers and on the other side we have the Developers, right? So the developer view, that's the other view, which also doesn't care about all of the different. Types of security tools. The developer also Has a need for a developer view which is a bit different from the attacker view but it also is a completely different view from the different security tools you have. What is the developer view? So think about it from a developer side so. You might have today a lot of different tools. Those tools are in different categories. You might have a a SAS tool and a DAS tool and a tool scanning container images, and you may have an ASPM and you have a uh a DSPM, an AISPM and CSPM. KSPM and like it's like uh a lot of tools right? and then you have an EDR and you have a network scanner and so all of those great tools, OK, think about it from the developer perspective. So for all for the attacker perspective, obviously this is not good, OK, because no one sees the problem. But from what about the developer perspective? What do, what the developer feels, right? So they, they feel. Very bad because they feel like a lot of different problems or tasks or tickets or balls fall on their head, right? So think about it from a a de perspective. I'm a deaf and I just get swamped with just a lot of issues, right? And I like, I don't even understand what I'm supposed to do because it's just, you know, so many different things so. It's both problems together you start understanding why it's broken so attacker view is missing today and developer view is missing today and the whole goal of security is to understand the attacker view and explain that view to the developer. That was supposed to be the role of security, which today it's not, it's not what security tools do. They don't take the attacker view and translate that to the developer view and what I say now translates across the. 20 different markets in security, right? Uh, API security AI security. It's a container image scanning, vulnerability scanning, SCA dust, SAS, secret scanning, data scanning, like all of those are just more boards that you run and you use, you know, external scanning, application scan, but it doesn't make sense. We need attacker view, we need developer view, and we need to connect them. Right, and, and, and that's, that's why like security is broken and we need to understand more than that and that's where I actually wanna hear the you also is like I feel this problem we have to speak about it it's bigger than the company, OK, because uh as, as everything moves to self-service to vibe coding and you know. Like everyone becomes developers and just the, the ratio of developers to security gets more crazy every day right now everyone on the team can build applications in an hour, right? The ratio, the speed of building applications gets more crazy, right? We need to have a mind shift. In the way we do security it's, it's a transformational mind shift. It's not like a small changes that like we cannot continue to operate in the classic. Model of security we cannot like this waterfall model where we have a lot of tools and then we try to translate them and then we try to chase people to fix them. OK, this is not going to work anymore. It's just like it's like a fundamental uh operational model and that's what we keep talking about in which like operational model of security and that's why I'm saying it's, it's not about a product it's about. Industry, it just doesn't work anymore. It just it doesn't scale. It does not work. So that's what we have to change, to change the way that we approach security to make it more self-service, right? To, but to make it much, much, much better because we cannot, we are failing in three things today one, we don't have the attacker view. 2, we don't show the developer what they need to do and 3. We don't skate. Like we need something that solves all of those three problems together, right, that allows you to focus on the attacker view, show it to the developer, and actually step aside so you're not as a security team you're not the scale issue, right? And that's for me when I look at security, the biggest challenge of the industry and that's why we are in the business and that's why I feel like everyone, every team, every security team should think. For their existing stick, how can we be more attacker focused, developer-focused, and more self-service? Um, any, any thoughts? So I will take this as an agreement. Uh, yes. I guess one of the issues that we have, we have a huge landscape. How do you identify, because I'm talking to rich, um, team about this, how do I identify the folks that own the assets or leveraging the assets. An ownership perspective easily. Yeah, so the question was, OK, this is all great, but how do I, how do I know who owns the problem right? if I wanna move to a self-service model, right? So I ask you a question, right? Uh, and that's why I always say like security should be more like finance, OK, because uh someone pays. Let's turn that out when you wanna ask? Oh, OK, that's good. Uh, someone pays for the for the resource, right? I'm sure that finance knows where to go, right? So I'm just saying you need to have crowd governance not just because of security, OK? You you need it for a lot of reasons and, and I'm sure that uh it's not like you have a finance team that just pays for everything on their own, right? So in the same concept. You need the owners, yeah, you need owners for finance and you need owners for security, but the point is that the basic, basic problem that security and finance should solve is who owns this, right? And by the way, a good governance concept is that if someone wants to create a new project, please tell me automatically who owns this from security, who owns it for finance questions, right? This is like basic stuff. It's more important than any other tool you have just basic stuff like every resource who owns it for security, who owns it for finance, right? And again that's even before speaking about insecurity features, OK? In my view, and again for me, I don't care, it's not about even which tools you choose, OK, it's more about the fundamental change of um concept, uh, in the security, but the problem is not the security team the change has to happen also in the developer community in the executive. In the board and this goes up to the company and the way you approach security, right? So it's not like about a specific tool or about the security team it's a mind shift you have to do with all of the users of the cloud, right? And because eventually. A way to solve all of this is by taking the um scan system, scan everything all the time, translate for every team what needs to be done and give every team the right problem they have to fix with the right context in the, in the with the right information, right? That, that could be a good solution, but for that you need first of all before even deploying a system you need the ability to agree with everyone. That you own your applications that you have to fix the problems and I don't have to chase you and then if I have a system that can translate every problem to the right team that could get us closer to a solution now, uh, if I have to summarize like the the way. The the way it should work, any a problem comes, it, it's an attack or view problem. It can be any problem. Eventually the the system can help you say these are the relevant teams to fix it. These are the owners, right? They should fix it and we monitor it. It can be a risk. It can be a vulnerability. It can be a malware. It can be aA alert. It can be a dust alert. It can be something in in the sensitive data exposed to the internet. It doesn't matter, right? The whole point is that it doesn't matter. There's so many different types of risk. It doesn't matter. The system has to be able to find the problems, route to the right team with the right context, um. Now it trying to summarize all of that, thinking about where security should go right? it's basically the understanding that security needs to stop being so vertical, OK, um, what does it mean vertical? We think about security in the wrong way today, OK? So for example, uh, when people talk about SCA, OK, what is SCA? SCA they, OK, you say SCA is something that I deployed to scan my code, right? Uh, but it doesn't make a lot of sense. Why are we saying that SCA has to scan in the code? I mean, the application is horizontal. The application lives in production. The code defines it, but it actually lives in production, right? SCA, you should have done SCA in production. Yeah, I mean, in production, you know what's actually the code that is actually running, right? And you know what libraries are actually being used, right? And then you can decide if you have SCA libraries that you should fix, right? So. There's actually nothing you're supposed to do just on code because it doesn't make any sense. The code is not the the it's just their origin. If you think about it, the application lives. Across the cloud, the code, the cloud, and the runtime or in the same time, right? So horizontal security means that when I do something I'm trying to do it across all of those layers together, right, because if I want to decide if I need to prioritize the question should be is it actually running or the other side if I want to fix something, the question should be who owns it. And the ownership is actually usually in the code, right? And the fix is usually in the code, right? So this combination between the code and the crowd and the runtime, it just means that we have to approach security a bit differently now. We don't, we shouldn't think about tools that are like an EDR that runs on the workload. Why do you need an EDR that runs on the workload? Maybe the workload is a cluster node and it runs a lot of services, right? And each service is owned by a different developer, right? And the developer knows a lot about what's actually supposed to be running, right? So it doesn't make sense to look everything vertically. You think you need to think about the application, the, the service catalog, the, the way services are built, right? So all of that is horizontal. That that's how developers see the world they see it horizontally and also attackers see it horizontally, right? And this concept changes the usual way we look at security tools and also security teams and also security structure usually we have different teams inside a security organization this can change the way that. You even build your security team, right? Maybe you don't need cloud security and application security teams anymore. Maybe it's a one, it's one problem. Why, why do we split the teams, right? When you split the teams you create politics. When you create politics you actually hurt security, right? And you hurt operations because each team needs to choose a different tool, so that that's a counterintuitive state, um. So I, I, I wanna, so I wanna hear your thoughts like, uh, this again for me this is not about with it's about the way the security industry should operate right? it doesn't make sense to keep thinking about things so, so much vertically. It's not efficient, it's not the way attackers operate, and it's not the way developers operate, so no one operates like that except for security tools. So we just need to change that. Um, yes, any thoughts? I, I wanna hear the crowd because that's, uh, yes, um. Any, any ideas because I think this is bigger than again not cloud security, right? This is relevant for API security it's relevant for SAST it's relevant for dust. It's relevant for ASIC. It's relevant for STA it's relevant for um vulnerability management on, uh, on operating systems basically everything is horizontal, even vulnerability management on. On the, on the base image, the base image comes from code, right? So you wanna do both at the same time, right? Everything is horizontal. Think about it even attacks horizontal because the process has to come from somewhere, right? And you need to ask the question, is it coming from my. Code or not, right? So basically if you think about the world of security we need to start shifting the way we operate, right? um and this is relevant for almost everything we do in security, everything, right? Uh, it's relevant for how we do secret scanning. How we do data analysis, everything. So that's it for me if I have to summarize like the biggest uh um change and discussion that we should have as the industry is how do we start shifting towards this model and how do we move all of that to become more self-service across all of our companies and and and I and in ways that that's what we're trying to do, right? We're trying to basically say let's build a platform that understands. Everything all the time scan everything everywhere all the time so I can give the foundational infrastructure for all of the security teams and developer teams to become sort of this uh language right that translates between everyone right so I I I think there's no there's no other way because otherwise if you invest uh let's say you have a product that scans uh IIC files in your apartment, right? That's a very. very narrow scope of a project like why do you scan only ISC files and only in the pipeline? You need to scan ISC files in the code and in production and you should have the same policy across all of the places, right? It's just, it just doesn't make any sense. Whatever you do, even if you just wanna scan IAC files, you should be doing that across all the places in the same policy, right, with the same tool. So that's, that's why like in our push and our focus is to figure out how do we give everyone a single view. Right, because if you can do that, you, you get answers on ownership, you get answers on priority, you have a single process for, for everything you do and this is most of the time that secops sec DevOps, security teams waste is actually just creating the connections within all the tools, right, and then chasing the developers to fix. It's basically like 90% of the time, right? Privatization creating the connections, uh, finding the owner, it's just not efficient. So, I know we're at time. Thank you so much uh for, for listening and then I'll see you around.
