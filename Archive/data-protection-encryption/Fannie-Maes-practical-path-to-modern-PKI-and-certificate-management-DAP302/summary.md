## Summary
This session from AWS re:Inforce 2025 features Dan, a product manager for AWS Private Certificate Authority, along with Cosmos and Nana from Fannie Mae's Information Security engineering team. The presentation focuses on Fannie Mae's journey to modernize their PKI infrastructure using AWS certificate services, specifically AWS Private CA and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

The session addresses key technical concepts around PKI management, including CA hierarchies, cross-account sharing, and certificate verification methods (CRL and OCSP). It highlights business challenges such as cost optimization, scalability requirements, and the need for automated certificate lifecycle management. The presentation also covers the newly announced feature of exportable public certificates from ACM, which allows for more flexible certificate usage both within and outside AWS services.

The speakers share Fannie Mae's successful implementation story, emphasizing how they achieved significant cost savings (approximately 1/15th of their previous CA solution) while improving scalability and reducing infrastructure management overhead. Their migration strategy included extensive communication with stakeholders, staged implementation across environments, and the establishment of managed trust bundles for development teams. The solution's integration with Venafi for certificate lifecycle management was highlighted as a key success factor.

## Key Points
- AWS Certificate Services include Private CA for internal certificates and ACM for public/private TLS certificates
- New feature announcement: ACM now supports exportable public certificates
- Private CA offers cross-account sharing capabilities through AWS RAM
- Multi-region resilience can be achieved through different CA hierarchy configurations
- Fannie Mae achieved 93% cost reduction compared to their previous CA solution
- Integration with existing tools (like Venafi) was crucial for successful implementation
- Staged migration approach (sandbox → dev → UAT → prod) was key to success
- Implementation required extensive stakeholder communication and education
- Certificate automation and lifecycle management are critical for preventing outages

## Full Transcript

Alright, well, welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope you're having a great conference. Um, we're excited to have you join us to talk about Fannie Mae's practical path to modern PKI and certificate management. I'm Dan. I'm product manager for AW's private certificate Authority, joined by my friends Cosmos and Nana from the Information Security engineering team, uh, over at Fannie Mae. So let's get started. Quick agenda, I'm just gonna give you a little lay down on what AW certificate services are at the, uh, so you get an understanding of what we do as well as some key concepts that will help you follow along Cosmos Anonymous portion of this session. Then they're gonna actually go in, talk about what they did and the challenges they faced as well as the lessons they learned at the end we'll do a quick wrap up of, you know, uh, key takeaways from the talk. So what are the AW certificate services? First we have AW's private certificate Authority or AW's Private CA. This is a highly, uh, versatile CA allows you to create entire CA hierarchies in the cloud, uh, gives you the ability to issue private certificates whether it is for mutual TLS devices, users, IOT devices as well. And it comes with fully managed revocation so you can use certificate uh verification list or online certificate uh status protocol. The other service is AW certificate Manager. It makes it really easy for you to get public certificates, public TLS certificates, and private TLS certificates to use, uh, at with AWS service end points and hosts. So I'll start with AWS certificate manager or ACM. So what is it? I'm gonna walk you through the flow to help you understand what exactly it does. We do as a service. So first you can request TLS certificates, right? And you can get them from our publicly trusted CA under Amazon Trust Services. When you get those publicly trusted certificates, you can use them with AWS integrated Services, for example, CloudFront. Go stick in a public cert on cloud front. Now you can terminate TLS. You can also get private TLS certificates from AW's Private CA, and when you get those certificates, you can also use it with the integrated services, but you can also use it with other services by exporting that cert and using it. To monitor these certificates, ACM provides monitoring through Cloudwatch and Amazon eventbridge, allowing you to know when certs are issued, when they're expiring, and then potentially even automate your processes and workflows. Now what if you have a cert that you wanna use with some of these integrated services but you don't want to use the public CA or uh Amazon Public CA or AO private CA you can import a cert. Right, provide the certificate along with his private key. ACM will bind that cert to the resource of the service that you want, and we'll make sure that you can use that cert. And I'm excited to share that today we announced that we have now exportable public certificates, so let's talk a little bit more about that. So what are exportable public certificates and why do we do it? We heard from customers that they like getting public certificates from ACM, but they wanna use it outside of those AWS integrated services or ACM integrated services. And so for example you could use a ACM public certificate to terminate TLS at Cloudfront, but if you want to inspect that traffic at a firewall like NextGen prior to it. Uh, terminating you couldn't, you can't use that same certificate that meant you had to go somewhere else, procure another public certificate, and use that to decrypt and inspect the traffic. Now with exportable public certificates you can use the same certificate to both inspect, uh, the traffic as well as, uh, terminate TLS at Cloudfront as an example. So what does that allow you to do? One, you, you get to consolidate, right? You don't have to go to another certificate public uh public certificate provider to get that certificate and use it alongside ACM. The procurement is also uh very quick. Within seconds you can get a public certificate on demand, no contracts, no blocks of certificates with the pay as you go pricing, uh, $15 for each, uh, fully qualified domain name and $149 per wildcard domain. You also get to use uh identity and access management just like you do today with all the other HW services to control access and permissions. Not only can you restrict who can call export certificate, you can also use service control policies to say what certificates restrict them down to even not getting a wildcard certificate, for example. Now, just to let you know. Any ACM certificate you've already uh issued public certificate you've already issued can't be exported, so it's not like you can give someone export capability and they'll come in and grab all the certs you've already issued. And lastly, as I mentioned before, we have the cloudwatch events, bridge events allowing you to get notified and automate uh part of your certificate life cycle process. So now I'm gonna pivot to private CA. What is private CA? Similarly, I'm gonna go through the flow to help you get a sense of what we do. Like I said, it's a versatile CA uh, managed CA service. It issues private certs, pretty basic, uh, and. You can use APIs S CLI and our SDKs to get those certificates, and you can use them with a wide variety of AWS services, whether it is with your containers, whether it is using IMOs anywhere so that you can give, you know, AWS creds to endpoints resources outside of AWS on their way in or with Active Director, right, with through directory service. But there's use cases outside of just the integrated or the services at AWS for example, you can use it with on-premises, uh, with Kubernettis, even if it's not Amazon EKS, and now it's devices, right? Lastly, common use cases are service meshes, VPN access, access to corporate network, right? Very common use cases for our private certificates, and as I mentioned before, we integrate with ACM allowing you to then use private search on things like load balancers and cloud front if you would like. Uh, jumping into the key concepts, um. Let's start with the hierarchy. So what is a CA hierarchy? Start at the top with the root CA. This is your root of trust. This is your trust anchor, if you will, and it comes down to your subordinate CAs that can be intermediates or the actual issuing CAs that issue those and entity or leaf certificates. The big thing to keep in mind is keep your hierarchy simple. Like it's, uh, the more CAs you have, even though it's a managed service, it is just more overhead. Deploy the root CA in its own AWB's account. You can take that account and restrict who even has access to it, which, uh, helps you protect that root CA even better, and then you could create separate admin and issuer roles. What does that mean? You can create a CA, but that CA doesn't do anything until you have a self-signed cert or a, uh, signed cert from a CA above and a level higher. And so you can say well this person can create a CA and this other person can actually issue a cert. Those two people have to come together to get an active CA, right? So you don't have folks just creating CAs and issuing certs without at least a couple people coming together and then if you're using long-lived certificates, we provide revocation as I mentioned. The other another concept that we're gonna talk or they're gonna share about is cross account CA sharing, which means you can have a CA deployed in one account using AW's resource access manager. You can share that out with another account and that account can be within your own organization or a third party, right? And so, uh, one thing about privacyA we have tier pricing, which means that if you share that CA with another account, those certificates add to your aggregate for your tier pricing. And here's an example of a setup where we have cross account sharing and as well as the Root CA um protected in its own accounts. So in the top right we have the Root CA in its own account locked down to only a handful of folks who can access it. The security team in the middle now has created an issuing CA and shared it out using AW's RAM to application teams in the bottom right. And then to potential third parties, uh, solutions in the bottom left, they may be providing something like certificate life cycle management. The other concept that we will talk about is resilience. So private CA uh is uh deployed across three avail availability zones within a region. Uh, however, if you wanna have multi-region cross region resilience, you can have a couple of options to do that. One is the example we have here where you have a root CA and issuing CA within the same, uh, region, and then you have another issuing CA in a different region that chains up to that first root CA. Right. It allows you to continue issuing if for whatever reason AW's private CA is unavailable in that first region. Another solution is to maintain two root CAs, right? And in this example you would have a root TN US West too. And the only challenge there is it has a little bit of complexity, right? You have now 2 CA certificates that you're managing within your trust store. But, um, those are your two options. I'm gonna briefly touch on certificate verification, right? Like I mentioned, you talk about being able to revoke a certificate. Why would you do that, especially if they're long lived. You may have a lot of reasons like the certificates private key got compromised. I wanna replace that, right? Another good example might be my employee. I issued a bunch of certificates to their laptop user certs, whatever they needed. They left the company. I don't want those certs to stay valid. I'm gonna go revoke them. And as I mentioned, we support CRL and OCSP. Lastly, before I hand it off, I just wanna share how do you use privacy with things like Kubernetes or Active Directory or mobile device software solutions or mobile device management software, uh, it's through connectors, so we provide a portfolio of connectors that allow you to use private CA through automation whether there's certain manager Kubernetes auto enrollment with active directory or with just the MDM solutions themselves. So wrapping up A those private CA versatile whatever private certificates you need, you know, really can't support you in issuing those certs at scale with automation. Uh, built on a secure and solid foundation, uh, what I mean by that is every private key is generated, uh, sign used for signing and deleted within HSMs, uh. We, we, when they're not being used, we sign them or we secure them using HSMs as well and we meet regulatory and compliance needs so you can check that out on our website. And lastly, what's the whole point of all this really is to avoid outages and improve up time, right? Like you want to not think about these certificates. You want them just to exist, and that's gonna happen through automation whether you, you're using ACM to do that, whether it is the connectors and using it with existing auto uh automated distribution solutions or using it with, you know, APIs or third parties. So that is my part. I'm going to pass it along to our friends from Fannie Mae. Thank you, Dan. Hey, uh, very glad to be here. We're going to talk to you about Fannie Mae's, uh, journey to using database private certificate authority and its associated services. OK, I'm, uh, Cosmos. I'm an information security engineer and operations manager over at Fannie Mae, and that's, uh, Nana, uh, he's one of our lead engineers, um, over at Fannie Mae on the, uh, security team. OK, so about Fannie Mae, what do we do? Well, Fan Mae plays a critical role in the US, uh, mortgage and housing industry. We provide stability, uh, liquidity and affordability, uh, for the US, um, housing market, and, uh, we really are, you know, part of the backbone, um, of American, um, housing. OK, so on to the, um, technology, the, the best privacy, why did we consider it? Because, uh, we, we had, uh, many different ways we could have gone, uh, with this when we started evaluating, looking at potential alternatives for our internal, um, PKI. Well, part of it was cost, right? Um, it best privacy was very, very, uh, cost competitive, uh, to what we're using previously I think it maybe came at at 1/15 of the of the cost of our previous, uh, CA, and so that was very compelling reason to consider it. And then compatibility, um, we use, uh, you know, uh, different certificate life cycle management, um, technologies if any may, uh, a very key one for us is Venify and, uh, the AWS5CA very, very nicely integrated, um, with that, um, there was a native driver in Venify, so it made it a very compelling reason to consider it. Um, there's also the, uh, uh, scalability and availability of the, uh, infrastructure because AWS manages all that. Um, they scale as needed to meet, uh, whatever demand we have, and, uh, it's a managed service, right? There's no infrastructure for us to manage, nothing for us to patch, upgrade, deal with, um, you know, uh, uh, OS retirement cycles that can, uh, come from, you know, traditional, uh, ADCS, um. Uh, uh, CA, um, architectures, so that was part of the reasons why we considered leveraging the AWS private CA service. So how did we pull this off? Well, um, if you are in the PKI space, um, you know that, you know, folks generally know that they, they need a certificate for TLS to secure their databases or, uh, their websites and, and whatnot, right? But, um, not everyone fully, you know, thinks all the way about you know how the PPI, uh, infrastructure works with trust stores and all the accompanying parts and so part of it was, uh, extensive communication, right? We let folks. OK, this is happening we're we're transitioning to a new route, uh, we need to establish trust for this new route. We held office hours because everybody had a different, you know, technology, you know, um, uh, uh, you know, perspective. Some folks, um, had applications running on mainframes, right? We had, uh, folks that, um, had Java, a native Java applications, Python-based applications like how do I, um, uh, adapt to this new, um, uh, root hierarchy. Uh, we also staged our, um, migration, right? We just cut over everyone at once. We did it incrementally, uh, we, we did a life cycle based, uh, you know, uh migration path, you know, starting with our sandbox environments to development, uh, you know, user acceptance, and then all the way to, uh, production. And then part something else very very key for us is we, we did two things. We stood up, uh, like an end point for our managed, uh, trust, um, bundles where, uh, develop, uh, development teams could go and pull down these bundles they could consume them either at run time. Some folks decided to pull it down, store it, and, uh, uh, um, build it into their, um, um, applications, uh, and we also stood up an end point for folks. Validate trust against uh the new CA um um hierarchy so they could just make any kind of uh web request right we provided uh code snippets, examples of how they could do this, go make this, um, you know, HTTP, uh, uh, you know, uh, web request to, um, this end point that we stood up and if you get, um, the right response then you know that you trust this new, um, uh route. And I'm gonna hand things off to Nana. He's going to talk about the uh engineering flow and the architecture for our, uh, AWS private CA hierarchy. All right. Thank you, Cosmos. Hey, uh, am I audible? Great. All right, so, um. I'll talk about how we've uh integrated AWS private TA in our current uh PKI infrastructure. Um, I'll start by saying or or stating the high level flow, um, of how all of this happens, um, so, uh, we have our client apps that require certificates, right? So, um, they call our certificate life cycle management tool, um, our main one which is uh Venify right now, um, and then entify generates a certificate signing requests, um, send it over to the AWS private CA, um, the CSR is processed, sent to Ventify and then back to the client. Right, so, um, just to go into a little more details on how all these pieces tied together, um, so I'll say the main two things that we needed um to make this work were, um, identify, I'll say. Um, so Venify itself has inbuilt, um, ACM drivers that allow us to integrate with the AWS ecosystem, um, to manage private and public certificates right across multiple regions, um, so that's the first main thing and then the second thing is, uh, obviously permissions to interface between, uh, the, the CA service, right? So, um, we run ourentify, uh, uh, um, application on low balance EC2s. And then um the EC2s have instance rules attached to them and then you know the roles have permissions required and interfaces with the uh CA service right so we do not allow direct access from our client apps to the private CA Benafi is the intermediary, right? So, um, as far as our clients, um, how they uh get to the CA we create API profiles within our Benefi. Um, and then we categorize our clients into, um, the applications that reside on-prem and the ones that reside in the cloud. So, um, you know, for on-prem we have uh in a custom built, uh, certificate generation tool that we call certgen and, uh, all of its underlying resources are, you know, it will be your services. Uh, specifically the ECS and then, uh, lambda. So just listeners for certificates requests that, uh, application teams request, uh, via ServiceNow forms and then, uh, same floor as I mentioned to process it processes it and then sends to our AWS private with CA. Um, and then we have our, uh, applications that reside in the cloud, right? So, um, we have the ones and, and, and with those two we categorize and, you know, subcategories too, so, uh, ones that deploy, uh, through our legacy pipeline that we call urban code urban code deploy UCD by IBM and for those particular clients we have, um, a dedicated lambda that licenses for certificate requests. And then uh we have uh you know, applications that deployed to terraform and Glab as well. So as far as uh scalability goes, um. As our, you know, infrastructure continues to scale across multiple, um, you know, business units and their workload requirements, um, a solution or CA solution like AWS private CA is, uh, simply ideal, right, because, you know, a CS solution that can scale automatically in the back end and dynamically without us having to provision any new infrastructure, right so. To support our resiliency requirements, um. We deployed two route TAs like um in distinct regions, right, so one in our northern Virginia region. And then another one in our uh Ohio region and then we have our automation utility round robin between the two, right? So, um, and one thing that we made sure to enforce amongst the support teams is the need to have the CAS for these two CAs in their trust stores so in case there's a failure in region 1, we just fail over to region 2 and we have continuity of services. Um, from an end to end perspective, uh, we integrate our PKI infrastructure, integrates with, uh, multiple AWS services, right? So we have ACM, uh, for our certificate inventory and expiration notifications, and, uh, obviously today with the announcement of exportable public keys and certificates, um, you know, we might be doing more with ACM. And then uh we have AWS cloud HSM which we use for encrypting our Ventify uh database key and then um we have another use case for code signing and those keys we store in our cloud HSMs as well. And then we have uh AWS Lambda, like I mentioned, dedicated for certificates requests and then we have a separate AWS lambda that handles backups from uh primary cloudisms to a secondary region for resiliency requirements. Uh, I'll turn this over to Cosmos to speak on. Thanks, Lana. So we definitely learned a lot of things, uh, going through this journey, um, with, with, uh, AWS Private CA, um, one important thing was, uh, PKI education, right? Um, application teams want to be enabled to develop apps, you know, quickly and effectively and efficiently, um, and it was critical for us to definitely meet them where they were at, help them understand how PKI works, um, uh, within Fannie Mae, let them know the requirements and how to, uh, build their, um. Applications in the crypto agile way where they were able to adopt the new routes um as needed we really start to uh work on this education, you know, pipeline making sure folks really understood this is how um you know PI works uh within organization. Um, so the next time we have to do, uh, a journey like that which we're, we're gonna get into with the, with the post quantum, uh, uh, uh, certificates, it's not as difficult because you know we have those, um, learnings and those, uh, uh, that knowledge built into our organization. Now key part was um identifying platform owners. This gives you the biggest bang for your buck when you're doing um a transition like this, right? We, we definitely went to like a centralized um uh Windows, um, uh, teams where they could deploy the new routes using GPO to all the Windows endpoints both servers and workstations, right? Same thing for our, um, Apple and Mac teams, um, using the, uh, mechanisms to deploy the uh the certificates to the, uh, trust stores, um, even. You know, we leverage uh um uh AWS, uh, you know, server manager for our Linux, um, compute, right, uh, for existing instances we're able to push the new, um, uh, routes to the, uh, right trust store locations, uh, across Fannie Mae. And then also, you know, think about, um, uh, you know, development, uh, tooling, right, you know, so our versions, our internal versions of, of Java that we maintain Python, we had to go find who owned these platforms bake it in, in there, right, so when it's consumed or if it if it's even uh containers in the container registry. You can, you know, uh, consume, uh, it, you know, uh, directly that way it makes it easy because our application teams already have, uh, built pipelines where they can just easily redeploy your applications and they don't have to go, you know, figure this out like all they need to do is, OK, I see that this the latest container has the new search baked in. I can just plan a new deployment for my application, redeploy that. I'm good to go. That was a very critical lesson for us. And then, uh, we also had uh two more items I'm gonna have Donna talk about. Um, so like Cos was said earlier, right, um, throughout the migration, uh, you know, journey, what we noticed was there was a, a lack of fundamental knowledge, uh, in, in PKI across multiple application support teams, um, and then, you know. We responded by posting detailed and extensive documentation or publishing um extensive documentation uh accessible for our application teams and um I, I, I could say over the period the knowledge, uh, you know, across the enterprise when it comes to PTI is, you know, has improved greatly. Yup, um, and then, uh. This is as far as inventory of of custom trust stores this is an issue that we honestly kind of still deal with not as much obviously, um, during the uh migration was, um, there there were application teams that, uh, built custom trust stores that may override whatever their platformsa trust store is, right? So, um, you know, and you know with uh PKI and and migration of CA doesn't happen as often so. Um, you know, they don't touch the client trust stores that much and then they lose track of, you know, where, you know, their trust stores are, so we had to, um, help most of these application teams find where their trust stores are even though we did not build it right so. Um, so as far as where we're heading with our PKI strategy, um, the most immediate that we're currently working on is, uh, a CRO distribution point that's, um, internally accessible. Uh, so I add Fannie Mae, um, it's a requirement to send any traffic going to the public internet through a proxy, right? So what we're finding is there are some critical applications that are simply not proxy aware. So, um, with, with the AWS privacy, the default OCSP endpoints and CRO endpoints are hosted on the public internet so these critical apps cannot perform, uh, revocation checks, right? So, uh, we've currently in our dev environment we built something that's being tested, uh, so we, you know, if everything goes well, promote the production, um, for the most part, uh, it'll be as privacy. Gives us all the key usages we have, but there are some one of use cases where you know an application team might need a certificate for um token signing or non repudiation right so. That so far I haven't seen that AWS PrivacyA has so we wanna have the conversation uh with AWS PrivacyA uh the AWS team and then see if we can introduce that, uh, if I may, uh, turn it over to Cosmos. And then we're also um obviously preparing for the post uh quantum um world um uh you know PQC is going to present uh challenges for challenges for the entire uh PKI industry of uh folks that run, you know, internal uh PKI uh practices. And also for public TLS, right, so we're paying a lot of attention to what AWS is doing to pioneer and lead in that space so we can learn and adopt, uh, uh, those, um, uh, learnings into what we do internally, you know, Fannie Mae, um, you know, often follows the, uh, uh, the CA. Uh, um, browser forum, you know, requirements for our internal PK as well. And so, um, things like 90 day TLS, um, and, and, and it's going down and down. I think I saw the other day Apple presented maybe a case for us at 37. Uh, 47 day certificates, right? We have to adapt to that world, right? We're, we're thinking a lot about how do we enable, um, our teams, um, to do this because, you know, part of our thinking is, it's, um, we have really good understanding of how we deal with, uh, certificates, even short-lived certificates internal to our organization. Uh, but you know you're going to have relationships with third parties that host, um, uh, websites for you that you need to secure certificates, right, when certificate durations started off at, you know, 5 years, 3 years, now currently 398 days. Sure it's, it's manageable. You can, you can have a rotation schedule that is, um, you know, reasonable why you can work with those third parties, but as such as the durations keep ratcheting down to um. 90 days and lower it gets a little bit more challenging so you have to automate right? There's gonna be a very huge push push for that. We're going to work with our partners at AWS to, you know, design, you know, probably new, new, uh, ways and new mechanisms where the, uh, these third parties can consume certs and make a certificate, you know, proliferation, uh, you know, internally and for our external partners much, much easier. Then uh we're gonna talk about some best practices I believe Dan, that's you. Thank you. I'll take this. Alright, we'll wrap up real quick with some quick hits on best practices for AW's private CA. We'll talk about, uh, the key takeaways, and that will wrap us up. So overall it's there's, we have a bulleted list of things, but it really comes down to be intentional, right? Take time to document what you're going to do. Think about your CA hierarchy. Think about validity periods at the time of CA creation, right? Once you issue a cert, once you stick a CA certificate into a trust store. It's a lot of work to rotate that trust store if you wanna go change something. Uh, as I mentioned before, keep this root CA in a separate account that really helps prevent, uh, access from folks you don't want to find the entity validity to be less than the certificate issuing cert CA. And lastly, use Aivist RAM to share your CA's like, uh, Fannie Maated not only with your application teams or. Uh, with third parties, but you can also do with your application teams, right, to optimize your privac CA usage. Two things we always say you should not do or we don't recommend you do. One is don't issue from the root CA, right your trust, it's your anchor of trust, your root of trust. You know you really want it to only issue subordinate CAs so that way if something goes wrong, you can revoke that subordinate CA cert and boom, all those certs down, uh, stream from there is not trusted. Uh, and you don't have to do a whole trust or rotation which you heard is kind of a pain. Don't pin to intermediate CAs. Intermediate CA's tend to have shorter lives, uh, than the root CA and really it starts, makes, makes it harder for you to understand your bound trust boundaries as you, uh, if you start pinning to intermediates. And let's wrap up here. So key takeaways from AWS is we have two certificate services AW's Private CA and ACM. One allows you to issue private certs. Uh, the other allows you to issue public certs that are both public and or TLS certs that are both public and private. And as we share today, not only can you use ACM TLS certificates with these, uh, integrated through services, you can also use them anywhere now whether it's workloads on EC2. Where there's workloads on prem or in some other hybrid multi-cloud environment. And then, uh, when implementing private CA, uh, we just learn, keep it simple. You know, you lose your audience, um, if you, you know, um, make the. Uh, the ideas and things you're trying to express about a PKI, uh, transition very complicated and very confusing for them to understand, you know, use simple ana analogies, you know, I, when I was, uh, uh, leaned on was the whole idea about, you know, certificate being analogous like a passport and the passport office is like the issuing and it's the the the trust anchor. So make, make, make it easy for folks to understand and meet you, um, uh, so that they can understand what they really need to do. The other thing is trust store management is is it's hard it's, it's uh challenging know PKI is a very decentralized, uh, system, right? And so you know there there's no, um, there aren't many opportunities to do central centralized management. But when you find those um opportunities lean into them early in the slide we talked about uh the relationships we built with our platform teams so where we could build these certificates, you know, directly into pipelines directly into container registries, uh into the operating systems themselves, lean into those opportunities, right, because they're going to make it very, very uh simple for you to manage your trust stores, keep them up to date, and making sure you're, uh, well equipped if you ever need to do a transition like this, you know, now or in the future. And then um using a generational naming convention, uh, that's what we we we did at Animate that just makes it because we know, um, this transition might not be the last time we have to do this, right? So we're we're going to have to potentially do this, uh, especially with the, uh, post quantum, uh, world that we're still going to live in. So being able to make sure you have a good, uh, naming convention for your certificate authorities and a good and solid hierarchy makes it easier to make a transition like this. All right, and that's our session. Thank you so much. Uh, please connect with us on LinkedIn. Please share the session and we'll be right down here if you have questions for any three of us. Thank you so much.
