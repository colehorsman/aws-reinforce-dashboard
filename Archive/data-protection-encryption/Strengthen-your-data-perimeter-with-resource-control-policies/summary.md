## Summary
The presentation focused on strengthening data perimeter security in AWS through resource control policies (RCPs) and multi-account strategies. The speaker, Gerardo Castro, emphasized the importance of implementing centralized security governance across AWS organizations rather than distributed control mechanisms.
The presentation outlined a continuous journey approach to setting up security controls, starting with evaluation of security needs, through policy creation and testing, to ongoing monitoring and improvement. A key emphasis was placed on carefully testing policies in sandbox environments before production deployment to avoid business disruption.

## Key Points
- Multi-account strategy is recommended as the primary approach for AWS governance and security control
- Resource Control Policies (RCPs) set maximum access limits across an organization but don't grant permissions
- Centralized control is preferred over distributed control for better visibility and governance
- Security implementation should follow a continuous improvement cycle, not a linear path
- Testing policies in sandbox environments is crucial before production deployment
- Automation through AWS Control Tower is recommended for implementing security guardrails
- Monitoring policy behavior helps identify potential security threats and optimization opportunities

## Technical Details
- AWS Organizations: Used for implementing multi-account strategies
- Resource Control Policies (RCPs): New permission type for setting maximum access levels
- Service Control Policies (SCPs): Used alongside RCPs for organizational control
- AWS Control Tower: Provides pre-built control library for security guardrails
- CloudTrail: For logging STS API calls and access patterns
- Amazon Athena: Used for analyzing CloudTrail logs stored in S3 buckets
- Cross-account access controls: Implementation through resource policies
- Identity policies: Part of the overall security strategy
- AWS STS (Security Token Service): Mentioned for role assumption monitoring
The speaker also mentioned having detailed implementation demos available on their YouTube channel "AWS Security Latin" (though in Spanish).

Hi, how are you? Can you hear me? OK, thank you so much. Um, my English is, is not perfect yet because I only speak Spanish, but I try to, to, to speak a lot uh uh English language. Um, I'm sorry for that. Uh, who I am? My name is Gerardo Castro from Peru. Um, I'm a security hero. I, in my employer Kaleos I were as security sales specialists um. I am here to talk about how to stop people from getting access to your data. Um, this is a bit of um. What we are going to see, but I won't stop here for uh obviously obvious reason. Um, first, have you heard about um multi-count strategy? What does Julio Cesar uh have to, to do with this? Uh, well, to, to have good governance over our ALS warlocks, the main recommendation today is to use a multi-count strategy. This way You can control each part of your organization and have a centralized security purpose. So what are resource control policies? Um, they are a new type of permission in ALS organization you can use them to to set the maximum level of access to resources in your whole organization. And they are a kind of protection that helps you create a data perimeter in your ALS account and stock outside access to your resources, uh, in a big way. In conclusion, RCP er do not give permission. They only set maximum limits. Uh, now, what security approach should we use? Let's look at the difference between distri distributed control and centralized um control. Distributed control um in short is the ability to apply er rules, uh security rules depending on on the knee but often in uh isolate way. At first, it can work fine, but later you see that you lose control and visibility. Because you have to respond to the specific needs in each environment. On the other hand, we centralized control, you get a central security governance. This is possible because there was a plan before where the required and strongly recommended security controls were defined. Then the scope is set for the whole organization. Now let's learn about the journey to set up a security control for data perimeter. This is not only for RCP or resource control policy but also for service control policy and what rails that you enable when using control tower, for example. As we can see It's a continuous journey. It doesn't go just from step 1 to step 5. there is one more step, continuous improvement. Uh, this makes the process an evolving path, not a fixed goal. Now, let's talk about step one. Phase one, tell us that we need to make an evaluation and understand what we want to achieve. Is it compliance, a confidentiality, uh, to limit cross access, for example, er, what strategy will help us protect the data. As you can see in the image in the organization has used a strategy where an authorized resource um can access another resource through a cross account access in AWS but it blocks any unauthorized errors from accessing that resource. And below, er, in the below image that there, there is a resource policy that made this possible, no. It's an example, it's a, um, example is scenari. In the phase 3, for example, we need to create all those security guard rails that will, that will help us meet our control objective or control goals inside the organization. Once they are created and set up, we move the next phase. Now we have talked about checking our needs or control goals, uh creating the security policies and then setting them up. Right? But we haven't talked about how the policies could cause a problem with business business availability. For that, it is important to test all our policies in a sandbox environment so that um when we move in our production environment, they don't don't cause any uses. They are different ways to reduce the impact of a policy. Um, that was not tested or or was set up in the wrong way, for example, first by fully knowing the trusted identity in, in my organization, in our organization. Another way is by knowing all the STS APA calls, for example, to see who is doing an a role. Uh, we can store clog trail logs in a bucket and use Attenna next to search through this data. In this phase, it's talk about automating the set up of guard rails. Um, one recommendation is to use control tower, which has a control library. er with it, you can use that thing of control by service, by security framework for. Example, PCI, whatever, um, or by control control work, for example, er how to to control um how to enable protection data, er protection logs, protection application, etc. In in this phase, it is important to watch how your policies behave, er, not only to see the possible impact they can cause if they are not well designed, um, designed or implemented, but also to understand which policy is blocking the most actions. This helps you to see the pattern that someone may be trying to use to break in your organization. Um, I have in, in my YouTube channel AWS Security Latan uh how to implement RCP SCP, uh, identity policy, resource policy in in a strategy of multi accounts ALS, but uh there is a problem. All the con uh all the content is in Spanish, in English for now. Um, so in, in this learning talk, I can't um show a demo because um show all the demo about how implement implementing um their perimeter using all these strategy is a lot, um, but maybe can you use Search in the, the, the YouTube channel at AWS Security Latin in in see the, the, the, the video and get the idea to to implement in your console. I hope this talk um can be interesting for, for you and that the next time I promise uh speak better my uh the English. Thank you so much.
