## Full Transcript

We want to talk about digital sovereignty and how to build architectures based on AWS on top of it. Over to you. Thank you very much, Armin. Hi everyone. So I'm going to get started with the topic of the day. We're going to cover some elements of our conversation with customers so you get some insight about what do we see on the market, especially in the direction of Europe, but not only. And then we'll be going through the digital sovereignty pledge to explain to you what do we mean by sovereignty. You'll get some insight as well as per our latest announcement on the European sovereign cloud, and then we'll get into some design principle and and exchange with Armin on observation how we can help customers moving forward. So let's get started and. The first part for our market challenge and customer anecdote, we are seeing firstly in terms of priorities, cloud sovereignty is very high on the agenda. Most of our customers have questions about our posture on sovereignty, and you know there's this report that we've been having from IDC. That is showing this number, so 81% is something quite relevant for us. Now if we look into the detail of the evolution of digital sovereignty over the past 4 years, we've had on one side a lot of concerns and customer questions as per where are my data, how can I control my data. On the other side, there's been on the market some potential solutions that were being offered that were rather feature limited solution. So there was a constraint there between the two and in the middle where I will go a little bit more for the next slide, a lot of things happening on the landscape. Let me just give you an overview here of observation. Now these are emerging regulations that we are seeing. They are not necessarily. Oriented towards AWS, but our customers are exchanging with us on those topics, and you see they are covering the whole regions there from the US perspective, Europe and Asia. So it makes a lot of dynamic in the area here and in that exchange with customers we've noted that there were 4 different topics that were really recurrent. So you see the first one about the data residency and the second one about operator access. This has been very early stages and we named that data sovereignty per se in terms of concerns and conversations with customers. On the other side, resiliency, independence and transparency are topics that we consider more operational sovereignty related. And when we bring the four together, this is our view on what is digital sovereignty indeed. We're going to go through several examples related to those those topics as Armin will present later on the session on sovereign by design. Now I want to give another perspective from CISPA. This is the cloud infrastructure service provider in Europe. It's an organization that is including several actors on that perspective, and you see here that they are expressing the intention to move with the cloud, to use the cloud in terms of technology, but then there are some constraints that are coming. With it, so freedom of choice of technology, for example, as well as control of the security and resilience are important matters so that essentially the technologies support the transformation. So I'll hand over to Armin here for thanks. Um, look, um, based on what Rick just said, right, I mean we're seeing quite a lot of different requirements and market challenging around the world. So basically about two years back it was basically in November 2022023 or 2022, excuse me, at reinvent we basically added our digital sovereignty pledge, right? And we want to take a quick look into it what what we said then and what we delivered until then before we get into more of the concept of digital sovereignty by design. The pledge itself, you can probably see it on the headlines here, it's pretty much aligned on basically requirements which Rodrigo outlined before. And as we see this, you know, it's creating regulatory requirement and risk-based requirement in that space, right? And even so we firmly believe that our, you know, AWS services and the AW AWS cloud is sovereign by design. We better get further ahead and make some commitments in further development in terms of data residency, data controls, more control over who has access to the data, transparency to the data, but also further extensive resilience of the cloud because it's all those four topics which we already talked about. So this was basically the pledge. It's basically online. It's much more to read behind it, right? But let's go one step further and let's take a look at what happens until there, right? I mean, we not only made a pledge, we had a couple of deliverables and you can see that on the slide, and we'll just pick a few of them, which we did, and you can see it's part of it it's really we added technology or we changed technology, we we just added new functionality on it. Other parts have been additional attestation and transparency, and other parts have been additional contractual commitment. And I just want to pick one example, so you can see the AWS nitros systems early 23 achieved independence validation from a third party. The nitro system is a fundamental part of our cloud infrastructure and it's been out since 2018. And we've always been talking about it, but we didn't have, I mean, external attestation for it. So we had the NCC group giving us this external attestation Nitro does what we're what it is supposed to do and what we promised it to do. But if you take a look then further down in the line, once we had this attestation, right, we added also contractual commitments. Based on this attestation, so it's basically following the line we build the nitro system we get the external party validation on it and we added it into contracts. And other things you can see we added things like external key store, static stability for EC2 instances and outposts. These are all technology components. But then on the right hand side you can see we announced, for example, the announcement with the German cybersecurity regulator where we're going into a cooperation agreement. So while we designed a lot of the functionality around sovereignty with the regulators, we're now getting into really a two-way exchange with those regulators and signed a cooperation agreement. Lastly, and this has been just out last week and it has been a big topic for customers over in Europe, we already announced our new entity structure for the upcoming European sovereignty Cloud Rodrigue will talk about it much more, but you can see over the course of the line we added quite a lot of things, and this is just a subset of it. Alright, so let's take a look to a couple of our um secured or sovereign by design components. So as I said, we firmly believe we designed the system. To it from the beginning, but a few things are I mean worth mentioning here and the first thing is, uh, let's take a look back to our region design. Um, I think on the one hand side it is important how the region design helps to build digital subty in the current AWS commercial cloud. And once we're talking about the European sovereignty out in a few moments we'll probably come back to that. But you've seen that, but you see the multi-region concept is basically giving us quite a lot of choice where you want to store your data, the customers have to choose where they store the data and in the majority of services we're basically keeping the data where you tell us to store the data and we'll come to that in a little moment because it's service by service dependent, but that is the location of your data choice. On the other hand, our concept of always having multiple availability concept really focuses on the resilience part of the sovereignty component, and we're already delivering this since many, many years with that concept that we have this highly available regions with low latency connectivity, independent power connection, all those kinds of things. So the majority of requirements we're seeing today can be really built in a single region deployment. Even so, some requirements will probably go above it, and you can go away and go over multiple regions, but it's a really fundamental part that our region design, which is also applicable for the European sovereignty cloud, is a key component. So that's basically the region itself. If you go one step further, I think it's also important, and we look back to it if we come to the second part of the session to look on the service types, and I would say in general we're breaking down. Our services in Two main categories and the first main category has a subcategory. So the zonal services are the typical services which are running in one availability zone, right? EC2 is the most prominent example for that. So your virtual machine will run in one AC at a time, right? That means resiliency on that side of the house. It's pretty much in the responsibility of the customer to build the architecture around the resiliency requirement in that concept. So then the next thing in the middle, the regional services, it's still where we are making sure the data or the data location is in the region right where we're taking care of a lot of the resilience component because we're replicating and making all the effort across the region. But in both of those buckets, right, the data stays in the region which you select and we're keeping also promise that they were not moving the data out. However, there are also some services in the commercial cloud today which are what we consider to be global services, right? IM is one of them in the nature of the thing, but also things like Cloud Front and the content distribution network, DNS and and quite a few more. Those those services are basically, you know, moving data around the world by purpose of it, right? I mean. And it is important in the design concepts later on that you're basically picking the right services based on the requirement, but this distinction here, it's really quite important to say look, everything on the Two left things, right, is still, I mean, staying in the region you select. The other one is a global service. It's also been something where we'll show some difference. All right, let's go next, um, the nitro system, and the majority of you probably heard about the nitrous system, it's basically our fundamental change on how to build virtualization, and we're basically doing it since 2018. So the nitro system. Has quite a lot of additional benefits other than security, but one of the foundational components is really the isolation, right, the confidential compute platform which we are providing to everybody just out of the box without doing any further ado, right? And it's important that the NITO system is really designed the way that the operator access. Does not even exist and this is where the NCC report came back into the games that look, we need some proof and some evidence and some attestation that the design of the system is following that pattern because it's fairly complicated to prove that something does not exist, but that is, as I say, the foundation of all the virtualization, so the no apparator access which we're having here. But on top of that, I mean we still need to operate it, and it's also important to understand that the Nitro white paper is a good source of truth for that that I mean even the operations which need to be done on the hypervi level which don't touch the customer data on the instances are still controlled by selected APIs tracked down all the way through, so the nitro system is a fundamental component of isolation and confidential compute. But as I said, there is no extra thing to do from the perspective, the cloud operator and the customer, right? There are other things to do if you want to get your own operators out of the picture, but we'll cover that a little bit later. Um, the next one, as you can probably imagine, I mean, is encryption, right? And all of our services which are storing data in a persistent manner support encryption today, right? Uh, we're also taking care of a lot of in transit encryption. We're giving you quite a lot of options on memory encryption based on the instance times, right? But we're building encryption into our services, and many of the storage services are now even moving to the concept that we turned those encryption on by default. In the past we left it pretty much to our customers to do so, but we really shifted that over a little bit. So having that said, right, um, encryption is the one thing on the left hand side we're seeing our key management service because it's also super critical right if you do encryption on the server side with the services that you have, you know, a well defined key management system and our KMS system, it's basically, you know, proven to be, you know, failure resistant and also attested to the FIS certification level on that end, right. However, some customers have additional requirements, and they want to own their crypto operation and their HSMs themselves, so we're also giving customers choices to use things like cloud HSM or even additional components which will allow you to put your HSMs even outside of the cloud. The truth is, I mean what we're seeing really in the field is that the maturity, and I would say it's in the 99% plus cases of the requirements can be satisfied with natively KMS right? but it is important that those other options based on your requirements are still existing. All right then, one last thing, and this is, I mean, for some customers relevant, for some customers it's not relevant, right? We talked about the regions and the different petitions, and we will come to petitions in a little moment by Rodrique where you're basically selecting our region where you store your data, but some customers have further requirements and as more we go to the right. I mean we're moving the data location sometimes even towards your own data center, so we're providing the capabilities to use outposts, which is part of our services connected to a region, but the data is in your data centers, right? The bigger version of this would be, for example, dedicated local zones where you have just a much bigger picture of that. But you can see, I mean, we're even on the state the location side is going into direction if you have certain requirements, well, we can even shift it into your direction if you want to. All right, so let's talk about the first option, Rodrigo, over to you again. Thank you very much, I mean. Um, so we've seen sovereignty by design and let's look now into specifically the European sovereign cloud. We have, um, firstly thought about this investment for the past 3 years. There's been conversation with those customers that I was referring to. We look into how we can address their requirement based on sovereign by design as explained by our mean. And came to the conclusion that we needed to offer more controls for our customers. So the European sovereign cloud is a new infrastructure that's a new region as explained by Armin. We have multiple availability zones. It's an infrastructure that is located in Germany. And um it is you know aiming to give customers further choice in cases of very stringent regulation requirements, right? This is also, um, you know, an investment of over $7.8 billion and uh we're intending to launch it by the end of the year 2025, so it's coming really soon. We have spoken about security controls earlier and here's a picture of what we're going to be able to bring to our customers that is an extension of what is already available today in the AWS commercial regions. So the first point you see. There will be an independent governance, and I will tackle that in a little bit more details, but essentially we are changing the governance structure of the entity that will be in charge of this new infrastructure. The Second point is that we will make it possible for the operational team to operate the European sovereign cloud indefinitely. And they will be able to do that in having access to a copy of the code that will be in Europe. The other point is we've published now in this article the sovereignty requirement framework. It's not yet visible for everybody, but it will be visible in our sock reports. So this is a framework that includes our best practices for applying security, privacy and sovereignty by design in the cloud, right. And essentially also the the operation security operation of this cloud will be dedicated and running in the Europe region. So these are the different controls that are intended to address some switching requirements from our customers. I will go a little bit deeper into the technical aspects and you know as mentioned the European sovereign cloud is meant to address the uh. Um, independency requirements that we see in terms of sovereignty and uh technically it means that this is gonna be a separated region it's gonna be isolated. You can see on the uh on the picture, you know, the commercial region and if you look into using the console you have the ability to get access to several regions Frankfurt, Paris, London, um you know that's really something that is available right now today. But you're not going to be seeing the European sovereign cloud in that console. It will be a dedicated console that will be separated where you'll be only seeing this European sovereign cloud region. The other element of it is that We looked into the different services, you know, the zonal services, the regional services, and the global services. The European sovereign cloud is concretely taking all those services and bringing it into one region. So the IMSA, the Root of Trust, the DNS, which are global services normally are actually being replicated and able to run independently within that region. So that is also leading to the other point. There will be a separated billing. It's going to be a separated contract. So this is what we're talking about in terms of technical separation. The second aspect is the ability to operate autonomously and in order to achieve that, there are AWS employees that are qualified, meaning they are being trained as well as having access to the tools needed for performing their duty. And there will be European residents plus located in Europe, meaning you know if I was uh working on the European sovereign Club in operations if I'm traveling here uh you know as here today in Philadelphia, then my access will no longer be available that's what it means uh being located in EU in association with, you know, uh, the operational autonomy. So those operational teams are gonna have the full control and you see the stack there in terms of being in front of the customer for customer services when support when cases are being open uh this team is gonna be there available for that uh for the daily operation of maintaining the service of technical assistance for management of the data center infrastructure as well. Meaning having the full power and capability to operate this European sovereign cloud within Europe. That's what it means in terms of operational autonomy. So we've tackled the technical independence, the operational autonomy. Now I can give you a little bit more perspective on the governance that we are setting in place, and we've announced on 4th of June. The new governance model, there will be Katherine Renz as the managing director. Karin Renz is a European citizen based in Munich. She's already working with AWS as VP for the AWS industry, so it's very well known within the organization. And next to the managing director there will be a security leader also European citizen and an advisory board composed by 4 persons EU resident and EU citizen, and also. A person will be external to AWS, so 3 persons from AWS and the 4th 1 will be external. That would enable us to demonstrate, you know, visibility and transparency in the way we are governing the European sovereign cloud. Now under this holding there will be 3 different entities that are matching what I was explaining before in terms of you know an entity in charge of the infrastructure, an identity that is in charge of an entity that is in charge of the operation, and the third one would be an entity that is managing the route of trust, the certificate, the encryption and the top level domain that will be in use. So all of that is you know giving for our customers transparency as per how we intend to run the European sovereign cloud. Now this is the foundational work I would say explaining you know technically or personally in terms of governance uh we are um you know bringing sovereignty into shape, but the important part comes there after. So remember, you know, in terms of market constraint there's sovereignty requirement that was on one side and on the other side the ability to innovate and in order to enable our customers to do so. We will be launching with a set of over 80 services, the European sovereign Cloud, meaning the family you can see there on the slide, but also including some machine learning, Amazon Bedrock, Sage maker, Amazon Q will be available to help customers using our services but also innovate going further in that direction. Moving forward, we have had a lot of conversation and exchange and interest from our customers to use the European sovereign cloud, and you see here a set of over 42 partners that are distributed in the technology and the consulting area, and we need them also to help accelerate innovation so the AWS services in conjunction with the AWS marketplace, the APN partners, consulting partner, technology partners are helping us to foster that environment. Alright, um, I mean, I leave it to you too. Thanks. Um, All right, so I, I think it's in the first part of it, right, we're basically elaborated really um quite a lot on what we provide as technology and choices in the topic of digital sovereignty, we're also provided some information on how we do operation. And we also provided some information on how we're doing basically the entity structure, the contractual commitment, and those kinds of things. However, I mean, it is also important, right? This is our part of the shared responsibility and and guess what, there is also a shared responsibility model if it comes to digital sovereignty. And I mean you you've seen that and you could probably find similarities we will look into some more details, but the second part of the session today is really looking into a little bit more what needs to be done from your perspective. I mean the customer's perspective, the partner's perspective, and the ISP's perspective. In today's sessions we really want to focus a little bit more on the technical side, right, but it is important to keep in mind to to say that, right. If you are operating on a sovereign cloud solution, no matter which one it is, right, and you are having also additional sovereignty requirements, they might also affect your operations and your legal perspective. This is just not something we can cover today, but if you think back what we do from those two topics, it's equally important from the customers or the or partner perspective. There's a certain inheritance, like with all compliance projects as well. But there's also stuff you need to do on top of it. Um, in today's session, the focus really want to go, we want to go really into this technical part of uh how to architect, so. Uh, let's talk about a couple of of concepts, right? And what we noted here is, I mean just a few design principle when it comes to sovereignty, right? And I think the the first one on top of it, it's it's quite important, right, applied standardized and enforceable controls. I mean, the fact is the landscape is still super fragmented in that space, right? You might ask 10 people what they define as digital sovereignty. You might even get more than 10 answers back. This is also why we basically introduced the sovereignty requirement framework for ourselves, and we did quite a lot of research with regulators and customers on what we really need to implement, but it is really super important that you standardize on your controls. And you might have also different requirements from different places in the world, so it is super important to keep that standardization of controls in mind. The next thing, I mean, and it comes back to our, you know, four topics of digital, right, you need to have visibility and transparency. I mean it's a key factor that people wanted to know what's going to happen. I mean who did what indicates they need to do something because the operator access as we provided with Nitro. It's possible in some spaces, but it's not always possible depending on the service you deliver or the stuff you build on top of it, and this is true whether you offer a solution on us or you operate it for yourself as a direct customer. You still might have the same requirements, right? Then we have I mean the continuous compliance we will see that it is something where we can learn from a lot of existing stuff we're looking for interoperability and and basically portability. I mean people are looking for. What is necessary in my design concept if I want to move out, if I move to something else, I mean how difficult is it? Can I build that already into the design, and we will look into that a little bit more deeper. And then I mean of course I mean design for survivability is a resilient concept. It basically says, look, I mean how can I make my keep my stuff operational. In case something bad happens, right, so these are the, you know, 5 principles we outlined here and we'll dig a little bit deeper in the next, you know, 25 to 30 minutes, but I think one thing which is important, especially if it comes to the technical side of the house. You don't have to start from scratch. I mean, our experiences, especially if it comes from the, you know, technology component, right? Security by design is one fundamental component of it. I mean, before I joined the digital sovereignty team, been in our security specialist for almost 3 decades, right, and I can tell you quite a lot of those components are overlapping and can be inherited on it. We we'll dig into a little bit more details in a moment, right? The next level is basically the privacy by design. I mean this is pretty much the same as we're also you know talking with customers since many, many years. It's also a fundamental component and a lot of things can be inherited. One thing I need to mention here in my personal opinion, the privacy by design principle is something which you really need to get in the forefront because in my opinion it's super difficult if you build your architecture without that principle in mind. It's very hard to implement it at a later stage. On the security side, it's also beneficial if you build it into the design, but you can adjust things later on easily than in the privacy sector. And then the last one, right, I mean, no wonder it's a resilient component. On the technology side, there's a couple of things to add, but I would say the majority of additional controls if we talk about digital subty are lying more in the operational side of the house. And the entity structure of the house rather than in technology, a lot of things can be reused. And this is basically where we also want to go into more details and what we thought we'd do today is we're trying to visualizing sovereignty as a kind of a stack and we're going boarding up and we're using some AWS services to plug them in to see how they can help you with that architecture and design criteria. So and at the bottom layer we're starting with, you know, really the foundations, right? And if you're operating in AWS environment today, I mean you, you can basically see there are things like AWS organizations and control tower and and other components on top of it. We are building you the foundation of building a multi-count infrastructure and multi-count in my opinion is 11 strong uh component of really building a sovereign and isolated infrastructure on your side of the shared responsibility and we will dig into that a little deeper, right? Uh, and the next layer is basically. Um, well, we said, look, I mean, what about the automation? I mean what about the shift left component, right? Build all those components into the build process. I mean, and you've seen we're basically putting in things like cloud formation, but also detective controls like config and security hub where you can basically start measuring if your controls are effective and again I mean you might be very familiar that if you're coming from the security side of the house. The next one is basically additional components and here you can see we'll name the KMS and I said, you know, usually I mean KMS is fundamental by the way, for all of the services which are storing data today, but there are additional variations where KMS has additional options which we're looking into a bit. And then we're also looking at things like a nitro enclave when it comes to you know operator access control or confidential computing for your administrators, right? And then lastly we're talking about things like threat protection, you know, identity analysis, I mean also stuff we heard yesterday and in the final and also talk a little bit about our concept on portability, on I mean how to choose the proper services if you have portability in mind. Alright, so that's a stack, and now we're basically breaking that down in 3 or 4 examples. So I'll start with the first one before I head over back to uh Rodrique, uh, and let's start with the foundational principle, right? And we, we said, look, I mean, AWS organization and my opinion like I said it's the core component for a multi-count environment, right? And. The biggest strength in my opinion of a multi-count environment that you are using the benefits of the identity boundary within a single account. So just by separating workloads across accounts, I mean you're leveraging quite a lot of the isolation technology of IIM right away without building them into very complex technology, right? You can also basically put guard rails, preventive guard rails and detective guardrails around. Your data location and all those kinds of things, so the foundation for all of that is AWS organization. And while you couldn't do everything with AWF organizations yourself, right, there are additional components which are helping you to implement those controls, and AWS control tower is one of those examples where we in the meanwhile introduced I think more than 440 controls just around sovereignty out of the box. I mean you just, you know, turn them on, turn them off on. I want to limit my administrators to only to use those services, those regions, and basically you're basically limiting your administrators in order to be you know sovereign and compliant by design and control tower is a fully managed services that provides you with that content out of the box. I mean, nothing you can't do without control tower. You could do it in organization manually yourself, but we're giving you basically those templates uh pretty much as a managed service. However, some customers and industry want to go a little bit further down the line, right, and want to have, you know, very specific guidance, templates, best practices based on their. Laws, regulations, whatever lending zone accelerator is going a little bit more further and it's giving you basically the capabilities to provide those templates very specifically to a regulatory body. I just want to put in one example. Last week at the Hamburg summit, we launched a C5 landing zone. C5 is the de facto standard for all governments and government related customers in Germany, so the cloud computing catalog. So basically providing a landing zone where we are building the template for you to operate alongside this framework out of the box, and there are many more. We have some for Spain. We have some for certain industry in the defense sector, the Netherlands. The landing zone accelerator is basically giving us the capabilities to write out of the box tailored to specific needs and requirements of industries or countries and so on. So if you take a look to this principle that action, we are now put it in this concept of, you know, have this X Y axis, right? And then you can see organizations is in the foundation, fully managed is AWS control tower customized basically based on requirements is basically the landing zone accelerator and that the landing zone accelerator comes with a huge variety of templates and we're even working on more of those. So it should show basically there are services which help you to do this implementation from the foundational level. Um, looking into, um, basically some of the examples, right, choice of operational responsibility, right? A multi-count environment gives you also the capability to say, well, I'd rather have a centralized or decentralized approach for my workload, so you might use. You know, detective and preventive controls to say look for this specific workload only people in this account in this OU are able to operate it, right? So that's basically the choice who will operate it. So we are separating our operators from the data, you might want to do the same. Um, convenience of use for test or prod. I mean in a multi-count environment you can have less restrictive control in order to give all the flexibility. To your basically administrators and developers, well then in a production environment you want to have much tighter control and organizations and multi-count is helping here for you right uh and then again the, the two samples I already talked about. Existing and standardized controls, we try to provide as many controls from the technology side out of the box so you can choose it or you want to have it really tailored to a specific requirement, well then landing accelerator might be one thing, right? And this is basically helping you also to implement those bespoke policies, especially I mean service control policies are a foundational component here. Uh, to limit your administrators to go out of the boundaries. So, after that, this is basically the lowest level and I'll take over to Rodrigue for the next 3. Thank you. Thanks, so we've seen really the uh the foundation part. Now there's an organization that is in place. There's a landing zone. You have the ability there to set in place your preventive control, and now you need to be doing a little bit more to bring the workload into that environment which is starting to connect your CICD. We give an example here of cloud formation. So from there on you have ability to make a choice and to shift your compliance to the left. We have a lot of tools that are enabling now to do that. It's very important to ensure that before anything gets deployed that there's verification points that are enabling you to reduce potential actions that could, you know, be required to restore the compliance posture at a later stage. Another perspective is also to understand that uh uh code is becoming documentation so you have a view with your code what is your current state, what were your past states uh when you're you know uh wanna look into specific events. The second perspective is about a WS config and security hub where you would be configuring detective controls on your landing zone which gives you the ability then to take action to notify potentially you know the developers about certain deviation and you can also communicate with the rest of the organization. About um your current posture's almost giving access uh to another person um in the organization in terms of governance and you have this cloud formation the developers that are concretely interacting with this and then you have uh the governance team um compliance team that's gonna be able to get the visibility they need as per what is happening within, you know, the overall organization. Now the third element we wanted to bring here is artifact. Artifact is actually um enabling customers to access to the audit reports from AWS. I was referring before to the uh the sovereignty requirement framework, the SOC report, the C5 report in Germany are available and that is enabling customers to understand. The compliance they are getting in the cloud to make up their decision as per what do they want to use, what services are relevant for their use case and workloads, and therefore have some controls being set to authorize the AWS services they have in mind or to deny the other one while using this SP or resource control policy from the lending zone. So same no view here to try to have some mental model on what is possible in terms of automation and then no evidence collection so you have the ability of course to you know bring further automation in your deployment um and um you know in your controls with config and security hubs uh for your environment. So you end up there um with these capabilities um with a landing zone that is in place. And then you can move on to create immutable infrastructure so that is then making the link between, you know, the evidence you have available, the immutability of your infrastructure that you can set up, which means you're in control of your posture of your sovereignty requirement um if any other requirement you would have to integrate this set of services helps you to. You know, get visibility into them and to, uh, then go to the next step which is effectively deploying your workload. So the um you know that was the second principle in practice around the deployment, the automated check, and then we can move on to, uh, you know, the design criteria you would have to take into consideration. So this is, you know, this is having an orientation of the workload and the use case you have. So is it prototyping or is that production workload? And then you can already sense there's different controls that you want to have in place. You may have some more relaxed control for you know sandboxing or test environment and you know all the types of controls that are more stringent when you're looking into your production. You have as well the ability to select your remediation strategy. Meaning um It is a capability that is available in the cloud, but you need to set up the governance to be able to implement it. so automated remediation comes with some responsibility and some impact that you have to discuss with the organization to know how far you're moving into that direction. Then you have to make some choice about what are the customs controls you want to use versus the standardized control. We have a lot of capabilities with config, notably also with the security hub to already benchmark yourself against best practices, but CIS benchmark as well so you can make up your mind as per how much standardization you need and what are really the custom controls that you need to implement and these are of course according to your. Um, regulatory requirements. But, uh, so We've set up the landing zone. We have An immutable infrastructure that is in place. Imagine that you have your VPC being set up, your shared services. Now the team are, from the development perspective ready to implement that their workloads and um you know if we take um really classical example from VM um implementation, you would take an EC2, a database load balancer. You know you bring all of that together, but there's more that you can be doing and it's important also to bring this information early in the design of the application so key management service, um, Armin spoke about it, but you have different choices that are available. You can have, you know, AWS managed encryption key or customer managed encryption key which gives you more controls as per the policy that you can set. You have also the ability to use cloud HSM, so custom key store, external key store. This is really depending on your regulatory requirements and it changes as well, you know, your posture in terms of responsibility you're taking, but this is the level of control we're going to give. The second aspect is about nitro enclave, so we spoke about um operator access and restricting operator access. Armin was presenting nitro system and therefore, you know, the isolation that uh you would generate the infrastructure later. So, um, let's say there's an easy to instance um AWS has no API. No whatsoever access to the data that are in that EC2 instance and uh you could make a decision as a customer to implement the same technique. Nitro Enclave does that for you. It enables to run an application in an enclave where um you know the contents of the application and the application itself is no longer accessible. Uh, for, you know, the people that will have access to the C2 instance, meaning in other words, you can create a similar isolation and implement yourself zero operator access in your environment using nitro enclave. And it gives the ability for customers there as well to um extend the trust boundaries and you can do that with key management services and you can start creating and yes there's some refactorization involved but you can start extending your trust boundary from the enclave towards other objects, the S3 bucket, notably using key management proxy. And the third one is about the certificate manager. We've seen there was some recent new feature on this that was announced yesterday by Air. So this is enabling then customers to export their private key and their certificates outside of AWS. A good use case of this would be um the I am rule anywhere where you'd be able then to. Implement access to the AWS cloud whether that is the European sovereign cloud or any commercial region using that technique. If we look into now uh the um um different axes we can implement route of trust on one dimension and we can implement isolation and you know just creating the picture here of how that could look like um according to how you want to use it. So these are additional protection that are effective at the workload level and then you have several considerations that I can highlight here. In terms of, uh, you know, single versus multi-tenant choice for your crypto domain, meaning in the direction of the HSM that you'd like to use. Then you have to consider also latency, connectivity and uh you know the the operational responsibility you're taking when you would be managing yourself in HSM. So we looked into removing operator access for the administrator and the developer and then um the integration of your services with certificate manager versus you know um a self managed uh requirement. If you look into a certificate manager you'd have the ability to integrate it with a whole set of services natively. From AWS and uh you know that that is concretely helping to develop faster. Well, so we have then. The different elements of the workload and then I would like to extend to the topic of the last stack of of the sovereign by design principle, so visibility, transparency and resiliency. Amazon Security lake is very useful for consolidating all the logs information and then being able to share it with other personnel of the organization. Audit manager, this is introducing another person out here where you give the ability to access evidence to an external auditor and you can automate the you know the collection of evidence and make the search of evidence easier with AWS audit manager. And the third point, the resilience hub. So we are now back in the direction of our digital sovereignty pledge, where resiliency is one of the four pillars and you have the ability there as an example to understand what are your RTO, your RPO, the objective you have for your workload there. Can be calculated with the support of this tool and you can even go further down the line with a fault injection simulation that is enabling you to understand how fast your workload would recover from certain events. And therefore automating the recovery phase. Now we look into two dimensions here, so achieving resilience on one side and achieving transparency on the other side, um, and this is, you know, the uh the guidance here on those three services that you can now understand through those two dimensions. I'm taking here some examples of design criteria. So you already mentioned RTO RPO very important conversation to have is really to understand the business specific requirement rather than the technical one. So this is enabling an exchange of communication between the developers, between the business team to. Create actually the infrastructure that supports the RTO and RPO. Then you have all the points that you can consider here and maybe I hand over to you about the audit manager if you could say a few words about this from your experience. I mean that's why I asked to let me make a couple of comments here, because we talked about the requirement framework which needs to be somehow adopted and also needs to come into evidence at the final stage. And we will incorporate our controls which we have defined over the course of the year in our artifact reports and let the independent third party audit our part of the cloud. I think the audit manager comes into place here as well because the same is true for you and as an ISO auditor for quite some years, which she did quite some audits with customers, right? I've been on the other side of ours. I made the experience that I mean usually when we came in and randomly asked for evidence on certain resources at a certain point in time, right? I mean the team operating were really running around and had a real difficulty to find the right evidence for the right time for the right resources because typically the auditor picks it up very randomly, right? We can't check everything, we'll make random selection. Audit manager really gives you here also the capabilities to provide this. Point in time evidence whenever an auditor asks you for it because it continues to collect all the data. So it is important for security and compliance, it's equally important in the future if the sovereignty controls come into place. I just want to add that experience because I said I wish I would have customers having such capabilities available. It would save both of us any time in the past in that area. All right, um, so let's go to the to the last part I think it's a good takeover and this is basically the portability thing, right? And just one thing and we can't go into all detail, but I think we thought it is super important to mention right when it comes to portability to highlight again, I mean we are basically. Owning quite a lot of open source projects which we are making available and a lot of our technology is based on those open source projects right on the left hand side I mean we have the one which are basically, you know, really creating and owning but then there's also quite a lot of other ones where we are taking over the leadership, right? But the key thing is right, a lot of our stuff is open source and really makes portability much easier. The other thing is that a lot of our managed services are also using open standards. Some of them are not, some of them are proprietary, but in your design and selection criteria, it is worth looking into that. And if you have high portability requirements. This is something you need to verify, but again, a lot of people have not really looked behind the scenes on what we are already doing there. Therefore, 490 close to 500 repository. If you follow that link, there's quite a lot of details on open source projects where you can, let's say virtualization stacks for container infrastructures. This is stuff we use. We also made it open source for you. So that's on the portability thing to wrap it up and I don't want to go through all those logos, right? I mean what we want to highlight here is that quite a lot of the things, especially on the technical and architecture side, are already existing and we put it all into these different colors, come to the principles. Keep in mind, we'll put it in AWS services behind it. If you're using other services, other software, other functionalities, the same is true here as well, right. What is also important, if you take a look at our well architected framework, a lot of things which we have already established as best practices for our customers has already been there. Even so, I mean we are working currently on adding an additional pillar. For the digital summit thing, but again this is not that complicated because we are also leveraging quite a lot of things on here. I just take that as a summary where we say look on the technical side, a lot of things can be used. I mean the principles are the same operationally and then entity structure wise it's quite a lot of other things to consider, but unfortunately it doesn't fit in today's sessions. If you want to learn a little bit more, there are, you know, courses. I mean they are pretty much. Driven for partners on competency requirements on skill builder, so I mean if you look just search for digital sovereignty on skill builder, uh there's quite a lot of courses on digital sovereignty available, uh so for consumption afterwards. And other than that, I would say thank you very much for attending this early morning here in Philadelphia. We would highly appreciate if you could give us feedback on the session. We always want to do things better in the future, and again, thank you very much for attending this morning.
