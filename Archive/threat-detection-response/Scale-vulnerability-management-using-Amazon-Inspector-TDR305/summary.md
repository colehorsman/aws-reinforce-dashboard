All right, last session of the day, uh, so really thank you for your time for coming to our session Scale vulnerability management with Amazon Inspector. Very exciting session for you today. We're gonna be covering the overview basics Amazon Inspector for those of you who are newer. Um, we're also gonna be going under the hood as well because we are joined by the product manager for Amazon Inspectors. We're gonna find out a little bit around what our scanning engines actually are, what our capabilities are, why do we build certain things, um, and then we're also gonna be touching on what's new. So with us today, my name's Kimberly Dickson, and I'm the worldwide go to market lead for Amazon Inspector. So my job is to work with product managers such as Nirali to really help. Prioritize road map. So getting feedback from customers such as yourselves to actually build the feature sets that's actually required from our security services. And Nirali, would you like to introduce yourself? Good afternoon. Thank you for being here in Nirali. This I'm the product manager for Amazon Inspector, and all your feedback is very valuable in having us build a product or a capability that keeps you protected every day. And then with us, we also have Alex. Hi everybody. My name is Alex Waddell. I'm a security specialist SA within our worldwide specialist organization. OK, awesome. So as I said earlier, we're gonna be covering an overview. So what is Amazon Inspector? What are the use cases we actually see customers using Amazon Inspector for today? Um, we're also gonna be deep diving a little bit around the key capabilities of Amazon inspectors. So like I said, why did we build certain functions and features? Why do we do things certain ways with an Amazon inspector? We're gonna have that from Narali and then Alex is gonna take us through the what's new. So what's coming from Inspector over the last few weeks, um, in the last few months, well, the new stuff that we've actually. Release to help you do things such as prioritization understanding scale actually managing vulnerability management at scale and then we have a very extremely long demo because we think that at AWS the best way for us to actually show you how services work is actually through a demo so we'll have a very uh we'll have a very long demo and then we will have might have some time for Q&A. Let's see how that goes. All right, so challenges of vulnerability management, why do we build Amazon Inspector? what do we think about when we're helping our customers and speaking to our customers around vulnerability management at scale? Um, one thing that came up a lot was volume and velocity, so constant CVEs um coming up, new vulnerabilities being discovered every day, and customers then ask us things such as how do I prioritize these, how do I prioritize the vulnerability findings that exist within. My environment to actually understand things like context. So prioritization beyond just my findings itself, but from a business context, how do I balance those CVSS scores against what what should I actually be patching? What actually should I be fixing within my environments? Um, things such as false positives as well that really does consume that kind of valuable time. How can I prioritize making sure that this is an actual finding within my environment? How do I know where my vulnerable container images are actually deployed? Um, that's something as well that we've thought about very, very clearly with an Amazon inspector in terms of helping you build that feature set. We also think about things like resource constraints, um, so resource constraints could be, you know, competing priorities between the business operations and also thinking about um the budget restrictions that we have with that so really coming back to thinking about helping our customers deal with that prioritization again to be able to apply those fixes where they're actually needed most. And then environmental complexity, so in AWS environmental complexity comes from multiple accounts across multiple regions. Um, these kind of environmental complexities are properly compounded as well if you have software supply chain, for example, third party dependencies. So all of that comes through in terms of what we call key drivers for vulnerability management. So what we want to help customers with is thinking about allowing them to do continuous development, um, and to make those changes without actually compromising on security. So helping our customers put in place guard rails in their member accounts so that our member accounts cannot change inspector scanning, for example, and being able to report that back into a centralized place. Next, um, thinking of helping customers with the growing complexity of compliance regulations is another thing that we've built in place with Amazon Inspector as well as eliminating the cost of manual processes for vulnerability management as well as visualization. So for those of you who are newer to Amazon Inspector, what is it? So Amazon Inspector is our automated vulnerability management service that continuously evaluates your resources, so your EC2 instances, your containerized images, um, as well as your code, and to give you an understanding of whether or not there are vulnerabilities, so CVEs, vulnerabilities that exist within your environment, but also understand unintended network exposure. When you enable Amazon Inspector, you can just get started with just a few clicks and I'll go into a bit into detail later on in another slide, but within that we immediately start doing 4 things automated workload discovery. Every time you deploy a UEC2 instance, Amazon inspector is able to go into that and actually see and conduct the vulnerability scan on top of that. We do continuous scanning, so it's not just a one time thing, it's a continuous scan that we do and we'll talk a little bit more around how Amazon Inspector does hybrid scanning, both agent as well as agentless scanning for EC2. We maintain a vulnerability database that not only is something that we update constantly, but also if you have a CVE that you wanted to check if it exists within the environment, Amazon Inspector also allows you to search against our vulnerability not vulnerability database and we also do near real time finding notification. All of this is sent through in contextualized findings, and you can take the action that you want to do via AWS Security hub, for example, we can do custom actions, Amazon eventBridge, or to any of our partners. Some of the benefits and we're gonna cover this a little bit in depth, but for those of you who wanna take one photo this is what we want you to leave with the benefits of Amazon Inspector on one slide like we said that continuous vulnerability scanning is something that we pride ourselves in, um, but also the seamless switching between agent based as well as agentless scans. Uh, we'll talk a bit around the contextualized inspector risk score in a few slides, but really sometimes you might have a CVE within your environment, but that is nothing without actually understand the context of your environment. So for example, is this exploitable within my environment? That's something that Amazon Inspector helps you do using the contextualized Amazon Inspector score. We also do the manage S-bombs allowing you to do S-bombs, um, centrally managed S-bomb exports for all of you monitored resources and like I said, automating those work flows. So one of the things that we're very proud of is the fact that it has one click enablement and integration of AWS organizations. You'll see this later within Alex's demo, but this is something that our customers actually don't actually understand how important this is. When you set your scan settings with an Amazon inspector within your delegated administrator account, these scan settings cannot be changed in a member account and as you know, in security, you can only protect what you know. So us having this ability to have this one click enablement with organizations that auto enables for new accounts, um, having that organizational level configuration. And giving you that centralized view and those guard rails in place is extremely important when it comes to vulnerability management. Next we discover and continuously scan, and what we mean by that is every single time you deploy a new EC2 instances, a new container image or a new lambda function, Amazon Inspector is automatically able to actually take that and do discovery of all of your resources. All of these findings is near real time so we have that continuous vulnerability scanning but also that network reachability scanning which actually uses automated reasoning in the background to actually understand whether or not there are network paths out through to the Internet and whether or not it is exploitable or not. And that intelligent algorithm is another thing that we we pride ourselves on. The intelligent algorithm actually determines what to scan and when to scan based on event triggers or heuristics, so that means that you know it's not just a one time scan that you schedule for example, any time a new software package is installed, whether or not a new resource is patched or a new CVE is published, Amazon Inspector uses that heuristics in the background to actually have that intelligence around what should be scanned within your environment today. In terms of contextualized findings for prioritization, as a security professional you do ask yourself these questions. Does the vulnerability exist within my environment? Simple question. Is the vulnerability exploitable? Is the vulnerability actively exploited? Is it a known exploit out in the path in in the wild? Which environment is impacted? This comes through in terms of Amazon inspector risk score and that's calculated for each finding by correlating vulnerability metadata with environmental factors such as the network exposure of that instance, the remediation details with fixed um in the package details so that you can actually see whether or not there's a fix available, and then exploitability details including last known exploit date all of this is delivered to you within an Amazon inspector finding itself. And lastly in terms of taking action with vulnerability findings like we said earlier, you can actually use our Amazon inspector findings whether or not you want to centralize custom actions through AWS Security hub, um, and then you can send it through custom actions or partner solutions or whether you want to create your own event bridge rules and then sending it through using Lambda and Systems Manager that's definitely something you can do with an Amazon inspector, um, and with partner applications as well that built all of the remediation steps on top of that. In terms of our vulnerability intelligence and Amazon inspector, all of our vulnerability intelligence is mapped against the minor attack TTPs, as well as the CIA known exploit vulnerability catalog. We also check against known malware kits and tools to that might exploit this vulnerability, and any critical security evidence, including involving this vulnerability is also given back to you. All of this is enriched via our partner recorded feature as well. And one of the lesser known features of Amazon Inspector is the ability for you to search the Amazon Inspector vulnerability database. So imagine that you know there's a new zero day vulnerability existing within your environment today. You just want it very quickly to understand whether or not this vulnerability exists within your environment. You can actually search this against the Amazon Inspector vulnerability database. You can actually see which resources might actually be affected within your environments today. That gives you the ability to see rapid risk assessment as well to do rapid response for these security advisories and I'm gonna pass it through to um to Narali who's gonna talk about a little bit deeper around those key capabilities. Thank you, Kimberly. Um, good quick show of hand of how many people use Inspector for EC2 scanning. Good. How many of that is hybrid scanning? Do I have to have an agent installed in order to get ECT scanning done? How many of us think that it's a must? OK good that's good that's better makes me feel good um let's touch on some of the key capabilities for inspector and then we'll get into the details of each one of these through the session between me and Alex. So the first and foremost, we started our journey by protecting or detecting vulnerabilities in your EC2 instances we identify as the instances are brought up. Or we will also when a new software is installed, go ahead and scan them or when a new CVE is detected in our vulnerability database and if it actually impacts your EC2 instance will trigger a scan automatically. So we'll continuously monitor them for CVEs with or without an agent. We expanded obviously by scanning images into your ECR or elastic container registry that's where they're stored we'll continuously scan those as well and then same thing with your lambda functions as and when they're invoked, modified, or a new CVE is published, we'll scan these. In addition to these compute resources that are scanned on AWS, we also allow you to generate a nested tree of all your software inventory, whether that's just a particular resource or account or at an org level. You're able to export that and we'll show you that in our demo as well. Certainly running CIS scans on EC2 instance is available. CIS scans is something that you can run on demand. This is not something that runs continuously. We understand that you may have compliance requirements that require you to generate a report as and when time needs. And last but not the least, we have capability to integrate through plugins shifting left on security to start uh integrating Amazon inspectors scan capability to the images during your build time so that you know that these images are free or less vulnerabilities exist before you put them into production. We'll show you that in as well. And all of this, I know Kimberly talked about it, that all of this is actually backed by research, so we have 50+ thread feeds in addition to security best practices, Amazon best practices, all of that clubbed in to map and detect new vulnerabilities. We also compute and inspect a risk score that triangulates all the data with CBE feeds, mort attack techniques and tactics. vendor databases our research security best practices plus the network reachability that she talked about or exposure also all of that combined gives you a particular score that is not just a CVE score but it's actually an inspector risk score a CVE score may be higher or critical, but an inspector score may vary because we've done a network reachability analysis. For that EC2 instance to make sure that it is, is there a path available? Is it reachable? Is it exploitable? And if yes, only then we bump up the score, otherwise we'll reduce the severity, allowing you to prioritize these findings. Um, before we get into more details on EC2 scans, I wanted to just pause real quick. To emphasize why continuous scanning is very important. Often times like customer says I just wanna do an on demand scan and call it a day, but we believe that security is priority number one, and you shouldn't have to wake up to news of learning of new CVEs to run to your APIs or consoles to go back and hit the button to say OK, what's new now? We strongly believe that the data should come to you automatically. So let's pick a scenario on June 1st, you know, 1516 days ago, you actually scanned. An instance there were 10 packages that were detected. Everything was good to go. No new CVEs were found matching to the package of the software inventory we collected no findings were generated for you. Everything's good. You move on. 10 days later there was a new CVE published in our database. You may or may not have read about it. There was no package in your image or your instance that actually mapped that CVE. There's nothing directly impacting you. We will generate no new finding. We are continuously scanning it. We know what your inventory looks like. We will generate no finding good to go. Tomorrow. Or 16 June. So today we get a new vulnerability that got detected this morning. Now this particular vulnerability actually impacts one of the packages in your image and the CVE is mapped to that. Without you taking an action, we will automatically create a finding for the vulnerability that got published this morning in our database. So you do not need to continuously keep coming back to run a scan. It's very important for for us to all anchor on this, the benefits of having continuous scanning. This will allow you to continue to have secure development life cycle and production environments running. Now, let's talk about scanning EC2 instance. We talked about continuously monitoring all your EC2 instances. By default, if your delegated admin configures EC2 scanning, we will turn on hybrid scan mode. Where available, we will leverage SSM agent if you're familiar with SSM agent, um, we will leverage these agents that are already installed on your EC2 instance to actually extract the metadata that is required for us to map it to detect vulnerabilities. Having said that, we understand that not all EC2 instances can actually have an SSM agent. You may be in the process of deploying them or you may not want to install agents or it may not be supported by SSM. How do we ensure that you're always detecting vulnerabilities through the coverage of all your EC2 instances? So where SSM agent is not available for various different reasons, we will automatically switch to agent-based, uh sorry, agent less scan mode, and that's the beauty of hybrid. If SSM is available, we actually fetch the software inventory through SSM plugins. If not, we'll actually do, um, agent less scan for you. You certainly have an ability to go into your inspector console or through API and change the setting to agent based only but we do recommend and by default um recommend to turn on hybrid so by default hybrid always for um agent based we will leverage SSM. There is a plugin available to extract the metadata map the metadata to the CVE database. If a vulnerability is detected will create a finding. For agent less, it is very important to know that the way we actually extract the metadata or the software. Inventory is by leveraging EBS, um, snapshots. We'll create a snapshot of all the volumes attached to your EC2 instance. Locally, in your account, it is very important to note that the data never leaves your account. We then leverage EBS direct APIs. To get the information that is needed for us to detect the vulnerabilities when in use once done, we'll delete that data. From your account as well. So for agentless scan, these EBS snapshot volumes are used to access the file system data, and we're never copying anything outside your account. And then What do we do for ACT scanning? I know Kimberly touched on it. I talked about it. Uh, we will do with or without agents, no matter what, um. For EC2 by default, we will do network reachability. For network reachability we'll actually scan, we first scan whether the instance UDP or TCP ports are reachable from the Internet, from the VPCH or from appearing connection. This allows us to tell whether these EC2 instances are vulnerable, are reachable, and then we'll map it to exploitable data. You do not need agent or agent less in particular. It works in any way as long as we know the EC2 instance, we're gonna be able to do the reachability scan. This is done once every 12 hours. The second thing we do for EC2 is package vulnerability scanning. Now, the package vulnerability determines whether there is a known CVE in any of the versions of the packages installed on your instance. For um. EC2 Linux based instances we actually do a deep inspection. Deep inspection is turned on by default for your Linux based instances. For brand new accounts, you do not need to take any action. What does that mean? In addition to identifying your software vulnerabilities in the operating systems, we will also identify vulnerabilities in the application programming packages such as Python, Java. No GS, etc. For agent base, we'll discover these packages. In custom as well as default paths for agentless, everything that's available will be able to just go ahead and scan them for application programming package vulnerabilities. This information for application inventory is collected every 6 hours and then the best part is it is turned on by default for Linux. And it is at no additional cost. So I would encourage if you've not turned it on, go ahead and turn it on if you're one of the older accounts, um, several years ago since we launched if you have new accounts in the past 3 years, you turned on by default. Summarizing all the EC2 hybrid scan mode is um turned on across your entire organization, all the finding details and the work flows. And the management for both agent versus agentless is exactly the same. There is no performance impact on your instances. And there is no explicit enablement by default, we will cover OS as well as application level packages for a vulnerability detection. Moving on, real quick to lambda code scanning. How many of us have lambda code scanning or lambdas standard scanning configured? How about code scanning? OK, what's the difference? Kimberly talked about it. As soon as the new lambda functions actually invoked, um, we perform an initial scan. If there is an update to your lambda function, we'll do the scan, and if there is a new CVE, we'll scan it for you as part of continuous management. Standard scanning package vulnerabilities are detected. Very familiar with it, um, we'll just go ahead and activate it standalone for all your lambda functions we'll scan them to detect vulnerabilities in your packages installed and we'll also come up with a suggestion for upgrading the package to the known best version. There is an add-on because we understand that there's not just software component for third party packages there's also your first party code that you may have written that you also may want to identify security vulnerabilities against. So on top of standard scanning as an add on you can configure code scanning. What does that do? It actually. Detects application code vulnerabilities, injection flaws, unintended data exposure, we cryptography, so and so forth. The scan works exactly the same way as standard scanning initial invoked at changes as well as CBEs detected, as well as when we build a new code detector for any of these applications that are supported, will trigger a scan automatically and generate a finding. In addition to just suggestion for code because we know what the best practices are will also create a code snippet as a code fix recommendation your developer can actually take it, download it, test it, validate it and bring it back into your code. Here's an example of a remediation recommendation. We have dozens of assisted code remediations. If it is a first party code and we've turned on lambda code scanning, you will be able to get a code scan recommendation. These are in context where it's been shown and highlighted in orange where we found the vulnerability green shows you what the recommended um code fix recommendation is and these detections and remediations um are always in line with what we use at AWS for security best practices. And then now let's have Alex walk us through what are the challenges in container image scanning and what are the upcoming solutions. Thanks Ali. OK, so when we think about um the security challenges with containers, we can break these down into three broad categories. The first one is building secure container images, and this is really about making sure that you're addressing security. At the container and the host level, not just at one but at both levels, and configuring the networks properly, securing the application and including the code and its dependencies. Second is insecure configuration of containers and the pods. So I'm not touching this, I promise you. I'll even hold it up. Container based images, reuse can lead to security risks if the vulnerabilities are not scanned and addressed. And then the third one is the continuous monitoring of the short-lived workloads because that's needed because you have to respond really quickly to the suspicious activity, and that can be a real challenge. So let's have a think about how Inspector might help. First thing that we can do is we can use the software building materials which Narai and Kim have spoken about already. So this is a basically a nested inventory or a list of ingredients. That make up the software components and that's really what powers inspector to be able to monitor the various resources that we mentioned earlier. And one of the cool things about Inspector S-bomb features is that we also make it available to you, so you can easily create your own S-bomb extracts, I think as Narai mentioned a minute ago, um, you can create those targeted down to the particular resources that you want. We can also export in two formats which is Cyclone DX and SPDX, which are the two main formats for SSOs. And when you get those exports, you can then ingest those into tools to be able to analyze those. You can build your own tools that are third party tools available as well. You can then decide, you know, when you're doing that, um, S-bomb export, what do you want to do? You can look at various resource types, you can select by tags, you can select by accounts. You can do this at your organizational level. So when Kimberly spoke earlier about the importance of having this one click organization wide um view and ability to scan all of your instances and workloads for vulnerabilities, you can also do the same for your S-bomb export. And the cool thing is, it's free of cost, it's just part of the service. We use it internally within the inspector service and we thought, why don't we just make this available to customers. And then one of the great things about Inspector, now that we've got this S-bomb tool, is that you can also now add that to your build pipelines, so that Azure developers are building container images, they can actually be proactively assessed for any security vulnerabilities. So we have native plug-ins for Jenkins, for Team Cities, for uh GitHub actions and Gitlab components. And what those native plugins will do is they will orchestrate the generation of the S-bomb and then sending that S-bomb as a text file to an endpoint within an inspector account which will then be scanned and then you'll get the response back. Once you get that response back into your pipeline, you can parse that. You can then decide, well, the number of critical vulnerabilities is above a particular threshold, therefore I'm going to stop the build. The other thing you can do is if you don't have any of those tools, you can actually still build this into your existing pipelines if you've got other third party tools. It's really simple to do, we've got, you know, instructions available online for doing that. The great advantage of this is it helps your developers to understand what the security vulnerabilities are as they're building their container images, and it makes them just better developers all around, and it means that the container images that they're hopefully building for you are gonna be more secure. Now, as I said, we also make that S-bomb generator available to you, but we also can make it available to developers. You can download this tool, you can put it onto your endpoint, your laptop, your desktop, and you can actually then scan images directly. If you're the number of times I've heard a developer say, well, you know, it, it worked on my laptop, right? Everybody hears that. Well, OK, if it worked on your laptop, show me what was actually present in the lap on your laptop, what what was the software build of materials. The software builder materials through a single command can be generated and then send that software building materials up to the inspector endpoint. The developer then gets the response and they can look at that and they can immediately try to understand what's actually going on within the container, what software vulnerabilities are they likely to be introducing into your environment if they were to take that off of their laptop. So let's now dive into ECR scanning, elastic container repository. There are two types basic and enhanced, or sorry, advanced. Now basic scanning is configured from the ECR console and it scans images on push only and it only uses the CVSS version 3 and version 2 scores. As Narali mentioned, um, we have other capabilities which we'll come on to in a second. Now you can do manual scans on demand, but what you'll get back is basic software vulnerability information, and it will also give you information just about the operating system packages. So you're not going to get the broader coverage that you might have expected to see when you'd be using an inspector. But let's talk about the other type of um ECR scanning, which is the advanced scanning, and that's where the inspector really comes into play, so. So the hand scanning again, you can enable this in ECR console. And when you first activate it, your repository is configured hopefully for continuous scanning. What happens is Amazon Inspector detects all the eligible images that you've pushed within the last 14 days. Then Inspector will scan the detected images and sets their scan status to active. It then continues to monitor the images if they were pushed or last in use within the last 14 days, which is a default setting. But you can then change that setting to uh up to 180 days. Um, so it'll either do it uh on push or last in use date or within the re-scan duration, and that's the re-scan duration that you'll set with an inspector. So what happens is that for continuous scanning, Inspector will initiate new vulnerability scans whenever a new container image is pushed or if there's a new vulnerability that's actually introduced into our database and that package is present in one of your container images. We'll identify vulnerabilities in operating system packages also in programming language packages like Python, Java and Ruby as well. One of the other great things about the enhanced scanning is that we will also take into account not just the CVSS but also the other information that can sort of contextualized scoring where we do that network path analysis, we figure out if that instance is actually going to be available potentially on on the internet if there's going to be certain particular parameters that are present in the environment itself, you know, exploitability data as well. So for example, the Amazon inspector score of a finding might be lower than the base score if the vulnerability is exploitable over the network, but Inspector determines that there's there are no open network paths to that vulnerable instance. And then what you also get within the enhanced scanning is you get enhanced vulnerability intelligence so we can answer questions such as is there an exploit available for this CVE? Is there a package fix available in which case which package is the minimum version I need to deploy? What about the EPSS scores if you're interested in those, we can give you those as well. We also can give you if there's any known malware kits that have been used to exploit a particular CVE. And that will all help you to have a much more rounded amount of information to be able to go talk to your, your teams and say this is why we should be patching these particular vulnerabilities. It's not just because the cued person says we should be patching. Now, let's move on to some of the recent enhancements with Amazon Inspector. So earlier this year we upgraded the engine that powers inspector container image scanning for ECR, and that image scanning engine provides a much more comprehensive view of the vulnerabilities in third party dependencies that are used within your container images. So that enhancement happened automatically. Nobody noticed that it happened. We deployed that across all of the organizations and all the accounts that everybody uses, and it didn't cause any disruption to anybody's workflows. What it might have done is it might have introduced some additional findings that might have been added as we've been able to do much more of that dependency collection capability, but also on the flip side, it might actually have closed some findings as the new engine has actually re-evaluated all of the existing resources to better assess the particular risks that you might be running. Now this new scanning engine then unlocked support for inspector to be able to scan things like scratch and disrelis and chain guard images, and with that enhanced scanning capability, it gives us expanded coverage of somewhere between 10 to 15% than what we had before. Then as we move into the expanded ecosystems, we started to introduce the ability to be able to scan and detect applications in ECR repositories that might have WordPress and Tomcat and Chrome and NoJS and Oracle GRE and JDK and Coretto from Amazon and Apache HT HTTPD. So all of those things can now be detected and we can scan for vulnerabilities inside those as well. It's all available via the scan API, which you can call programmatically as you saw a minute or two ago, but what this is going to do is it's going to give you that broad vulnerability assessment across not just your operating systems and operating system packages, but also the third party components that you might have deployed as well. So this is the enhanced container security management process and what we now also do, and this is an amazing new feature that we launched, which is we automatically map your ECR images to specific tasks that are running on ECS or pods that are running on EKS. Now we do this, this has been a common ask from our customers for, you know, a long time and I love the fact that um it's probably quite hard for you to see, but there is, I think, a box at the bottom that just says deployed pods and tasks, and there's a little hyperlink there. A massive amount of engineering effort went into that and we're really proud of being able to do all of that work and to make it as simple for you as just click on that hyperlink and we'll show you all of the pods and tasks where a container image was running the last time that we scanned it. By doing this, what this allows you to do, it allows you to understand I have this vulnerable image, I now know where it's deployed, therefore, I now know which particular pods and tasks I now need to go and do a rolling update to to deploy the latest image so that I can reduce the vulnerabilities in present in my operational environments. Another great feature that we launched, and this is really just for informational purposes, uh, the, the particular finding that gets raised as a platform end of life. So who here, and there's no shame here, anybody still running a Windows 2012 or a Suzie Linnox 12 instance? OK, a couple of people, yes. Um, well, Inspector now supports, uh, the ability to identify discontinued operating systems where it's running on an EC2 instance and also an ECR container image. What will happen is that if we identify an operating system that is no longer in support, we will generate a finding. You can then use that in part of your prioritization strategies so that you can decide is this something I should be targeting over and above maybe some other critical vulnerabilities that might exist in other in other operating systems that you have deployed. Of course what we're doing here is we're taking care of updating that list and maintaining that list for you, which frees you up to just focus on addressing the risks and not trying to maintain lists of which operating system, which version of an operating system is still in support. OK. Let's do a bit of a demo. Now this is recorded and I will walk you through it. So this is what the console looks like in the organizational account. I've got a delegated admin account here and you can see I get a view of my coverage. I've got 100% of accounts. I've got some critical findings. I have findings with exploit data. I have risk-based remediations. I can see my accounts that I've got the most critical findings. Now as a security person, this is invaluable for me. I'm looking across the whole of my organization. I can see all the ECR repositories with particular repos and particular vulnerabilities. I can see my ECR container images, so I can see I've got a couple of container images that are of um of interest to me, I think I've got AMIs with critical findings potentially and also my lambda functions. So all of the different workload types that both Kimberley and Narali have spoken about, all of that information is presented here in a dashboard for you that you can then dive into and get visibility of. You don't need to go down into each of the accounts to do that. And talking of going down into each of the accounts, what you see here is the ability at the top and the account management to automatically activate it for all the new member accounts. You can activate each of these capabilities independently. They're not dependent upon each other. But once you do enable them, you can see if they're active. Now there's one particular account here that is deactivated, so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go in. And it's not the account I'm in, it's a separate account. I'm going to activate that. It takes a second or two for that to run through. What's happening is inspector in the background is going into the inspector service in that particular account, and that's enabling it. So there you are. It's actually activated the lambda code scanning. I didn't have to do anything in that account. I don't have access rights into that account. It's the inspector service that's doing that on my behalf. So I get a full visibility into all the different instances that are running across my different accounts. I can see if they're agent based or agent less. All of the ones that I'm running here are agent based. I can see all of my container repositories, again, if you could have multiple accounts with many container repositories, you can get full visibility across that. You can see all the container images and you can also see all of the lambda functions. I can also see that there are certain functions that are not eligible for scanning because they've not been invoked in the last 90 days. So as Norali said earlier, if something's been invoked or published in the last 90 days, it's in scope for scanning. Same for code scanning, but there's also an unsupported run time at the time when that was deployed and it was probably more than 90 days ago. The operating system wasn't then supported, but it is now. Exporting of S-bombs today you can go into the inspector console in the management account. You can put in lots of different details around the filters. I'm going to put in an Amazon Lambda function AS Lambda function, pick Cyclone DX. I've got a bucket already prepared. I pick my bucket and I'd put a KMS key in and I would then export it, and it runs in the background, creates a job and sends it out to that bucket for you. Here's my EC2 scannings as Narai pointed out about hybrid being the default, my account here was agent based, so I'm going to set that to hybrid. That now kicks off a task in the background, takes a couple of minutes to run. While that's running, I go off and I go looking at the ECR scanning and you'll see we've got this rescan mode which is last in use and last pull date. And when I do the last in use or last pool, I can go from 14 days up to 180 days. I've got it set at 90 days just for the purposes of this demonstration. And then we have the image push date, and again, the default is 14 days, I've set that at 90 days. When you set it here, as Kimberly said earlier, when you set it here, it gets enforced down into all of the other accounts. Nobody can make changes in the lower accounts. Vulnerability database search. This is really, really helpful. Put in the log 4G vulnerability. I'll search for it. I get all of this information for you. I get details about the operating systems that it's vulnerable. I get the criticality of it. I get the CVSS score. I also get vulnerability intelligence from CISA and Amazon, and I also get a whole lot of other information at the bottom. But crucially, I can click on view findings and then a single click. I'm able to get visibility into all of the instances that have that vulnerability across all of my organization. How many of you here have had that question come from management? I came in on the train this morning, I heard about this new vulnerability. I need to know by 10 a.m. where we are, what's our position on that? How many of our instances have got to be patched. Takes you seconds to do that and inspector. It will show you all of the instances, all the lambda functions, all of the container images that have that particular CVE. Really, really powerful. OK. Next up, this is now the member account, one of the member accounts. And in fact, it was the member account that had a lot of these vulnerabilities. So let me just set that to play. So we're gonna look at lambda functions and you'll see I've got 4 lambda functions here and I've intentionally put 2 insecure lambda functions in for demo purposes. And it's got a number of common web uh exploits, in which case it's highlighted here on line 45 that there's a log injection issue. Now it hasn't given me code remediation there because based upon the code, we didn't have the confidence to give you a code remediation straight there, but I have another example here which is a SQL injection and you'll see line 16. And I've just made that a little bit bigger. So it's a particular uh SQL command and you can see that line 16, it says, actually what we should be doing is we should be doing validation of those particular parameters. So here's a suggestion that you can take. Put that into your development environment, test that, make sure it still works. And your developers, you know, haven't really had to spend an enormous amount of time working out what the code fix might be. Let's look at uh ECR findings. So I'm looking here, I've got this ECR repository. I've got one particular repository, it's got 28 critical findings, but it turns out that when I look at it and I'm looking down here again, I'm just in this one account, I can see I've got a lot of vulnerabilities in this WordPress, um, uh, particular image, so. When I'm looking at this, I can see I've got, you know, 1,374 mediums and 600 highs. There's no way I'm going to just go and actually patch each one of these individually, I'm probably wanting to roll a brand new image. And be able to then deploy that, but where, where do I deploy it? I click on that link, I get this pop up that says I've got 6 running instances the last time we scanned it, and here's a link here to the ECS task. So this is now sending me straight over to the ECS console. I can see the ECS cluster task. I can see all the information about this and um what I can do is I will create a revision. So I'll create a new revision of this. I have all of this information, I could at this point if I wanted to make any changes, but I can see I've got this image, and this is the image that's at fault here. It turns out that I do have another image, which is WordPress latest, and I go back to ECR, copy the URI. Paste it in, and we see the changes to WordPress latest. Again, I could change any of these settings if I wanted to, but I'm not going to change any of those right now. I'll create that. So what that's done is created a new version of the ECS service task. I now actually need to update the service. I need to tell the ECS cluster to update to the latest, and that's what this is going to do. So I picked the cluster. And it says the task definition is what WordPress task and It's going to, if I go down to the bottom, click on update. What that will now do, you'll see if I just click on refresh in a second. There we go. It will say deployment is now in progress. That takes a couple of minutes for it to run and you'll see that I've got 0 pending and 6 running, and again, just waiting a few seconds I can go back and refresh and ECS is now doing all of that work for me to one at a time roll through the doing a rolling update because it said there was actually a rolling update that it's doing. And when it does that, it will then show there'll be 0 pending and 7 running, which got 1 of the old ones and 6 of the new ones. You see it there's 7 running. So now what I've done is I've actually updated my ECS cluster. Didn't take me very long to actually do that, very targeted, very focused. Let's move into the Engine X one. So I've got an Engine X and I've got this running on 10 pods. Uh, it's got 44 tasks and, uh, sorry, 4 pods and 6 tasks. I'm going to leave the ECS cluster alone because I've already been working on that, looking at the Engine X1. When I click on the Engine X uh task information, it sends me over into the console for, for this. I can see the deployment. And I can see, I can click on this and I get essentially through to the same same screen. I can see the deployment name and the deployment name is called R equals Engine X1. So now what I'm doing here, I can see it's also a rolling update is the way that the the cluster is set up. So what I'm doing, and you don't see it here, but I'd execute the cube CTL command to apply an update with uh a new image to it. So I've now applied that, I go back to my cluster. I go into the deployments. And it was Engine X1 was the app. And so you see that it said it's running Engine X 1.21.4, a refresh and EKS is extremely quick at doing the updates and it's now running Engine X latest. And that is how the Uh, inspector scanning for ECR, ECS, and EKS works. So Do you want to cover this, Kimberly? Yeah, absolutely. Thank you Alex. All right, so, um, how does this all fit together? Um, so all of our detection and response services that includes the services like Amazon Guard duty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macy, all this flows through into a central service that is called AWS Security Hub CSPN. What I will say that's pretty exciting for you guys is please don't miss the keynote for tomorrow because we're gonna be releasing something pretty new and pretty exciting that involves all the services you see on screen. Um, within our security of CSPM service you can also send these findings through into our log collection service called Amazon Security Lake. Um, so Amazon Security Lake service allows you to do centralized log collection across accounts and across regions with just a few clicks, and it uses the open cybersecurity schema framework in the back end, so that's actually making sure that all the schemas for the log sources, whether it's third party log sources or AWS log sources or other cloud log sources are all in a standardized schema. Um, we have a service that helps with investigation of our findings, and that's our Amazon detective service, and we also have a 24/7 incident response service, um, where you have access to certain responders, security, uh, customer incident response team responders that can help you to do, um, response as well as recover from security events. All right, so things you should not miss, um, TDR 301, please bookmark that on top of the keynote tomorrow morning, be there bright and early. There's gonna be a lot of releases from our guard duty service. There's gonna be a lot of releases from our secure. hub service and you're not gonna wanna miss this um from the inspector service as well we also have an embargo session which one was that Noreli APS 203 where Amazon Inspector is going to be releasing something very exciting. Um, and the rally is gonna be presenting that, so make sure you have that locked in your calendar APS 203. We couldn't APS 203. We could not put that on the slide, but telling you guys now, um, also come to TDR 301. So that's innovations and AWS detection response for integrated security outcomes. We will cover in general across guard duty, inspector, security hub, putting all of our services together. And giving you those latest updates, so just be on the keynote slightly deeper as well and we also have two workshops for you to go to, um, secure container workloads of AW security services which will be using our inspector service as well as our hands on threat detection response service, um, with AWS Security where you get to be hands on with guard duty, inspector, security hub, detective. So definitely bookmark these sessions you'll like to learn more. And of course we also have very important blogs and other useful resources, um, the new stuff that came out, so container image scanning, um, EC2 scanning, lambda scanning, and our inspector resources definitely come and learn more. uh, Norali, Alex, and I will be outside as well, um, after this to talk to you guys more and ask, uh, have answer your questions and thank you very much for your time. Thank you.
