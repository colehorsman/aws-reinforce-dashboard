## Summary

This session presents the first preview of the enhanced AWS Security Hub service, unveiled as a comprehensive unified security solution addressing key customer challenges around fragmented visibility and disconnected security signals. The presentation, delivered by AWS security specialist Kimberly Dixon, explains how the new Security Hub evolves beyond the existing CSPM service to provide automated correlation, risk prioritization, and streamlined response capabilities.

The enhanced AWS Security Hub introduces revolutionary "exposure findings" that identify toxic combinations of security issuesâ€”such as EC2 instances with vulnerabilities, assumable IAM roles, access to sensitive S3 data, and internet reachability. This contextual approach transforms isolated security findings into actionable insights by correlating threats from GuardDuty, vulnerabilities from Inspector, configurations from Security Hub CSPM, network exposures from automated reasoning, and sensitive data from Macie into a single unified platform.

Key innovations include attack path analysis showing network topology and resource relationships, real-time asset inventory with security-focused resource views, and native integrations with ticketing systems like Jira Cloud and ServiceNow. Built on the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF), the service enables partners to integrate through standardized data formats while maintaining backward compatibility with existing Security Hub CSPM functionality. The solution addresses the critical need for confident prioritization of security findings and enables organizations to move from manual analysis to automated correlation and streamlined incident response.

## Key Points

## Full Transcript

OK, guys, my name is Kimberly Dixon, and I'm a worldwide go to market security specialist with AWS Web Services. So for those of you who were coming for detection response, we will be covering this, but what this actually is was it's an embargo secret session for the first preview for partners on our new AWS security hub service that we announced today during the keynote, so you'll get to see these capabilities. You'll get to see why we built AWS Security Hub. You get to understand the use cases and the capabilities um within the feature itself, and you'll also learn about how you can integrate as partners to the new AWS Security hub service and how you can consume the findings from AWS Security hub if you're a partner such as a security analytics partner or an ISV that's able to take in these findings in OCSF. So why don't we start building AWS security hub and what were we actually trying to fix? One of the key things we looked at was the fragmented visibility. So one of the things that customers tell us all the time is that our detection and response services come in building blocks, and this was something in the first step that we are looking at creating a comprehensive unified solution that helps with that visibility. Next, we focus on the limited context for security issues within our customers' environments. So on AWS at the moment we look at all of our security findings in a very unique sort of way. So guard duty has unique security findings. Security hub is unique. Security findings. What about thinking about the way we could correlate this so that not only will you get these findings but you get the additional context of this as well. One example is if I have an EC2 instance and that EC2 instance has vulnerabilities on it. That's a great finding, right? I can see that this vulnerability is something that I must fix, but the additional context could come from the fact that this EC2 instance might have an instance profile with an IAM role and a policy that's providing me administrative access, and that administrative access might also be providing me access to an S3 bucket that has PI information. Um, not only that, the EC2 instance might also have a network reachable path out to the internet. And what that means is that now we're looking at these toxic combinations of vulnerabilities of this configurations of IAM threats, and of sensitive data, and that's what we're talking about when it comes to context when we're looking at our critical security risks that also leads to the disconnected signals and the delayed responses to critical incidents as well. So all of these were the challenges that we were helping our customers fix when it comes to the new AWS Security hub service. So like I said, this is what we're hoping for fragmented security with multiple tools moving towards a unified solution. Manual analysis coming up with automated correlation being provided to you from the AWS Security hub service. The limited context that you might potentially get from native services at the moment with enriched insights and lastly delayed response times maybe because you have to try and make sense of your findings and try to think about how you can stitch these analytics together into a streamlined response processes. So the integrated security solution is our AWS security of services. So this is the new AW enhanced AWS security hub solution. Um, firstly, we're taking in all the threats from Amazon guard duty, the vulnerabilities from inspector, the controls and configurations from security hub CSPM. The network exposures that we get from the auto rate made of reasoning network reachability findings as well as sensitive data from AC all of this put together providing these additional insights of um actionable insights, correlation, risk prioritization allows you to actually use the AWS Security hub service. The key benefits that we see, and this is what we're striving for for our customers, is a unified security operations allowing you to actually confidently prioritize the findings, so understanding that a critical isolated finding is not the same as a critical finding that shows you these toxic combinations, so really adding to that confident prioritization and that's like I said earlier, the streamlined response as well. So what happens to the old Security Hub CSPN service? So if you're a partner, you're probably sending findings through into AWS Security Hub today. Um, into ASSF and maybe having security hub show you these findings, um, that continues and that stays, but what is the delta? So what have we added on top of the AWS Security hub CSPN service? So CSPN service does the security findings aggregation from the partner findings or AWS Native solutions and adds on the cloud security posture management that looks at our configurations against things such as the NIS 853, CIS benchmarks, etc. The new AWS Security hub takes the functionalities of the AWS Security Hub CSPN service and adds on that automated correlation layer, the risk prioritization, as well as the streamlined response. So this is what you're gonna be seeing in the next few slides. I've got screenshots showing you what the console actually looks like, but these are actually the features that exist within the unified console of the new AWS Security hub service. We're going to provide you those exposure findings so that toxic combination that I spoke about earlier, um, the ability to see an EC2 instance with a CVE with an assumable IM roll to an. 3 bucket with sensitive data we call that exposure findings and it's a completely new finding type the same way that when guard duty released attack sequence findings it was a completely new finding type. We're gonna provide you an attack path analysis and that looks at the network topology what are the resources that is within my network um that leads to that. EC2 instance with that vulnerability we're going to provide you an asset inventory, and that's a real-time asset inventory and the ability for you to search, for example, across all of my EC2 instances in my AWS organization, which of these have findings, which of these are public reachable, and really providing you with that resource-based view of the findings within Security Hub. Um, in terms of triage and alerting, um, all of this is available in the open cybersecurity schema framework and for those of you who are not familiar with the OCSF, that is an open schema, um, it's a standardized data format, um, that we've worked with multiple partners to make sure that the schema, um, is the same when it comes to your security findings. So all of this is available in OCSF, and that's OCSF is basically what's underwriting the binder, uh, the security hub findings, um. You can also still take in findings via EventBridge, so if that's the way that you are currently consuming AWS Security hub findings or our AW Amazon guard duty findings, you can still continue to take that through via EventBridge, but now we also provide automated ticketed workflows to Gira Cloud as well as ServiceNow, meaning now that you can actually cut tickets or create tickets from our AWS Security hub findings and put them in through into your integrated ticketing workflows. All right, so starting with the key capabilities, this is the unified console of the AWS Security hub Service. On the left hand side you can see the threat summaries that come from Amazon guard duty, the exposure summary findings which I which I said earlier, was a combination of our Amazon inspector and our AWS Security hub CSPN services, the resource summary view, so as you can see here, I have an S3 bucket and. I can see for this particular S3 bucket whether or not they have any exposure findings, attack sequence findings, as well as other findings, and lastly a security coverage view. So security coverage view is extremely powerful because you're able to see within the security coverage view which of my AWS accounts have Amazon Inspector turned on, which are my accounts of Amazon Guard duty turned on across my environment. So giving you that comprehensive coverage of which uh solutions actually turned on within your AWS environment. So the greatest thing about this is that you have all of our security findings within one console and you don't have to toggle out of this console. So you'd have to go back from guard duty into security of CSPM or into Macy. They're all combined into one unified console. The next thing is an example of an exposure findings um that's available within our uh within the security hub dashboard itself and that exposure findings were those toxic combinations that I spoke about earlier. So with the overview side you can actually see the accounts, for example, you can see the contributing traits, so traits are essentially the signals that we have pieced together to actually raise this particular exposure finding. Examples of traits would be things such as reachability, so whether or not that particular EC2 instance is reachable via the internet. It is a vulnerability finding that comes from Amazon Inspector, a misconfiguration type finding that comes from Security Hub CSPN. We have others, and we have two others which is sensitive data, um, and assumability, which is an IAM role that could could actually be compromised. We have a potential network attack path and like I said earlier, that shows you the network topology um of that particular resource and where that sits. Um, you can't see too clearly on screen, but you can actually see that the EC2 instance I can actually see if it's part of a subnet, which VPC's in, whether or not there is a network ACL, whether or not it's protected by ALB all the way through into the internet gateway, and all of this is traced through and overlaid in terms of the traits that you can see from AWS security hub, so the reachability, sensitive data, vulnerability, misconfiguration, the seemability. Um, you can also see that I have, I can also have an IAM role here that has access um to an ECT instance as well. So all of this is combined so that um we can actually see the potential attack path of what might be happening within your environment. Um, next, this is just a bigger view of what I showed you earlier, but again you can pivot and dive slightly deeper to look at that attack path and explore each of these contributing traits on top of these security hub findings as well. So all of this just allows you to actually prioritize remediation based on that attack path risk, um, and helps you protect your resources, uh, more critically. The next thing we're also providing is a security focused resource inventory, which allows you to see things such as, you know, for my EC2 instances, which ones are publicly reachable, for example, which ones of them have security findings. Um, at, uh, public preview you'll be, you will be able to see this resource based view across your organization, but at a very fast follow we're gonna be providing a real-time SO view for all software dependencies that are actually attached or deployed on your EC2 instances as well. And lastly, in terms of streamlined response, we have built in native integration with ticketing tools such as GRCloud as well as ServiceNow and the idea of this is really for us to actually allow you to use these security findings and take them through and integrate them into your ticketing workflows that you already have and that that exist in your environment today. So Security Hub has all of these native capabilities as you can see earlier um but the current AWS Security hub CSPM is not going away it's just going to be a capability of the AWS Security hub service so if you are still, if you are. Still using AWS Security hub within your environment or you're a partner and you're sending findings through to AW Security Hub CSPM you can continue to do so. The Security Hub CSPM service is not going away but instead becoming a capability of the AWS Security hub service. So as a partner, how would you be able to integrate with the new AWS security hub? Security Hub, as I mentioned earlier, is completely written on the OCSF, which is the Open cybersecurity schema framework. Um, it uses that OCSS schemer framework to allow for data standardization and to future proof our services as we look for integrations with our AWS security hub service. Um, for security analytics partners, um, the way that you would integrate with AWS Security hub is for you to be able to take in the OCSF findings through into your security tools if you are a GSI partner or an SI partner or an MSSP, um, the. Ideas for you to actually be able to look at using um AWS Security hub to actually help with your customers um and to give you that additional prioritization and correlation um so that you're able to help your customers uh with their security findings. So these are the two main ways that we see customers uh partners currently integrating with the AWS Security hub service. OK, so just to be very clear, these are the new features that we're getting from the AWS Security hub service, but AWS Security Hub CSPN continues to exist. Um, how do we actually see customers using Security Hub? Once again, unifying the cloud security operations, allowing them to prioritize and investigate critical risks, monitor the cloud security posture as well as to respond to scale. OK, and um that's it from me. I can open the floor for any questions. I'm good, thank you.
