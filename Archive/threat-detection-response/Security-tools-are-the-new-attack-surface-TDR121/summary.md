## Summary
This session from AWS re:Inforce 2025 was delivered by Nick Fisher, VP of Marketing at Zaffran Security, focusing on how security tools themselves have become potential attack surfaces. The presentation begins with a case study of an Israeli hospital that suffered a devastating cyberattack in 2020 despite having security tools in place, which inspired the founding of Zaffran Security.

The speaker addresses key technical trends, including the rise of vulnerability exploitation as the primary initial access vector for breaches, surpassing phishing and stolen credentials. A particularly concerning trend is that medium-severity vulnerabilities (CVSS) are more frequently exploited than high and critical vulnerabilities combined, while AI tools like ChatGPT are accelerating the speed at which vulnerabilities can be exploited.

The presentation introduces Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) as a new operating model to address these challenges. CTEM is presented not as a single tool but as a comprehensive program involving people, process, and technology. The solution involves creating an exposure graph that maps attack surfaces, vulnerabilities, and security controls, while using AI to assist in prioritization and remediation recommendations.

## Key Points
- Vulnerability exploitation has become the primary initial access vector for breaches
- Medium-severity vulnerabilities are more exploited than high and critical ones combined
- Average time to patch is 40 days while time to exploit is just 5 days
- AI tools like ChatGPT can exploit 87% of one-day vulnerabilities
- Enterprises typically have 60-80 security tools deployed
- Security tools themselves have become part of the attack surface
- CTEM is emerging as the evolution of traditional vulnerability management
- 95% of organizations are seeking new vulnerability and exposure management solutions
- Organizations can de-risk 90% of critical vulnerabilities through proper contextualization
- Proactive exposure hunting is an emerging practice for mature security programs

## Technical Details
- Exposure Graph technology maps attack surfaces, vulnerabilities, and security controls
- Integration with network controls, EDRs, and cloud controls for risk assessment

Good morning. How are we doing today? So we got some folks sitting back in coach, still got some first class seats available up front if anyone wants to move up. um, so I'm Nick Fisher. I'm the VP of marketing at Zaffran Security. I'm gonna talk to you about our our talk today. Security tools are the new attack service, but I'm gonna kick off this morning with a bit of a story. This is a story that our founders at Zaffran were very close to. There was a bit of the inspiration for starting the company. So in the peak of COVID in 2020, there was a major hospital in Israel that was hit by a cyber attack. The attackers exploited a vulnerability, moved laterally within within the organization for about three months before deploying some ransomware that completely crippled the systems of the hospital. Patient histories, blood types, scan results, everything was locked away. Lives were at risk amid the chaos, the doctors were scrambling. One doctor looked to the other and said, We don't even know their blood types. So they had to go and result a lot of pen and paper to figure things out, even if they had those records on site. Now here's the shocking part this hospital already had the tools to protect against this, yet the attack still succeeded. This is the inspiration for starting Zaffran. So smash cut 3 years later, where are we today? You might have seen around the RSA time frame a couple reports came out. This was from Mandient to the MTrends report. It showed that vulnerabilities are now the primary initial access vector for breaches. So this showed that about a third of vulnerabilities, 13 of breaches start from exploits. That's more than phishing and stolen credentials combined. The Verizon DBIR report, which, as many of us are familiar with, also showed the exact same trend, right? Uh, vulnerability, exploitation, surpassing fishing for the first time. Very similar story. Here's another stat that we found very interesting, this came out earlier this year. So vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of medium are more exploited than the highs and criticals combined. Especially important for anyone who is tracking SLAs against criticals, patch all the criticals. A lot of the customers we talked to are starting there. This is sort of an eye opener for them. OK, so you're combining vulnerability exploitation as the new breach vector with how are these getting popped? It's through the CVSS mediums largely. But it's not just about the, the impact. Why is this happening? We know that defenders are being slowed down, but attackers are also speeding up at the same time. On average, it takes about 40 days to patch. But 5 days to exploit a vulnerability, another data point from this year, right? This is from the Verizon DBIR as well. Um, let's talk about AI a bit. This is actually one of the interesting use cases of AI is Chat GPT is being heavily weaponized to find zero days as well as, uh, exploit one day vulnerabilities. Chat GPT-4 was exploiting 87% of one day vulnerabilities from a report earlier this year. So time to exploit is now going from days to being measured in hours. Something is fundamentally broken in the system right now. But we've all invested in a variety of tools, right? So we're protected. Here's some more stats for you. On average, an enterprise has between 60 and 80 tools deployed in their organization. We talked to customers who have upwards of 150. OK, so each new attack surface in the organization gets a new tool and the tool sprawl piles up. I'm sure many folks in the audience here are grappling with this today. We've deployed a lot of these tools. We're configuring them, but there's a challenge here. The tools themselves have actually now become part of that attack surface. Most tools are actually not configured to mitigate the risk of vulnerability exploitation, and the presence on the asset can give a false sense of security. And beyond that, the vulnerabilities in the tools themselves have become a target, largely within edge devices. I think we've all seen the the stories from the past year on that, right? So this is a major trend OK, so we believe it is time for a new operating model. I'm gonna talk a bit about what that looks like for some of the customers we speak to today. But I will say we actually did release a report this year called The State of Threat Exposure Management, and it is very clear that you are not alone. If you are looking for a new solution. 95% of organizations are looking for a new way to do vulnerability and exposure management because they recognize that things are not working. So let's talk about, uh, let's talk a few buzzwords. It wouldn't be a presentation without at least one acronym and buzzwords, right? Before I talk about CTE, does anyone remember like show of hands back in 2018 when zero Trust was like becoming a big buzzword and everyone was talking about it, like everyone remember I see some nodding heads. So like CTE is sort of approaching that status from what I see in the market today, but I'll talk a bit about what it is and provide a little bit of clarity on how our customers are thinking about CTEM and exposure management. Effectively it is the evolution of traditional vulnerability management. It is not a tool. You don't buy a CTE. It is a program like Zero Trust that involves people, process, and technology. But let's break it down. What exactly is CTEM trying to answer? And it's a series of questions that we hear from our customers, right? And you can see that it is sort of taking a bunch of different existing spaces and trying to bring it together to holistically answer the questions of, well, one, what do I have in my inventory today from an asset management standpoint. 2 of those, what is vulnerable to me, so some vulnerability assessment. Very importantly, and we'll talk about this more today, risk contextualization and prioritization. Are these vulnerabilities actually exploitable in my environment based on how I've deployed and configured my systems and the existing context that I experience these vulnerabilities in, right? It's not the CVSS mediums that I'm necessarily focusing on today. How do I know what is the true risk for me and my organization? Then how do I take action against it? Action can come in a couple different forms. One is mitigations, right? How do I effectively defuse these vulnerabilities maybe ahead of patch cycles. But then eventually I'm gonna want to patch a lot of these things that I determined to be a high risk. So how do I effectively do that? How do I communicate it in a more automated way as opposed to all the manual work that I'm probably experiencing right now. And then many people are trying to then say, well, how do I actually then validate that this is truly an exposure that I am safe beyond just sort of the theoretical simulations that I'm experiencing. These are the components of sort of a modern CTEM program and really we are seeing more and more organizations have explicit initiatives against CTEM. So I'm gonna talk about sort of the role that a tool like Zaffran can play in something like this, and I'll share some insights on how actually Gen AI is being effectively deployed in these modern stacks, but it all starts with the data and connecting the dots, right, because we have tool sprawl, 60 to 80 tools, we have an expanding attack surface, so what this all starts with is what we call an exposure graph. This is effectively mapping. All of your attack surfaces, what do I have today in my inventory? Connecting that to exposure such as vulnerabilities, then understanding how those vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited. What is the attack vector that is used? What are the attacker techniques and the TTPs that are associated with that? And then what are the security controls that can effectively come in and mitigate that, not just the presence of something like a Palo Alto firewall, but going a little bit deeper to say what is the actual rule that can be configured and deployed to block that. In this case, a brute force attempt of the regression vulnerability we remember from last year. So this is what underpins a lot of the insight that can help you do it deploy an effective exposure management program. And really you remember from a couple slides back trying to answer the question what is a risk to my environment going beyond the industry standards CVSS or EPSS scores to look at my specific context and how I have deployed my tools and what is actually effective in my environment. So this is, these are the questions we're trying to answer using context across your on-prem and cloud environments for a hybrid cloud. Starting with a VO score, CVSS EPSS layering on what is actually loaded memory in runtime, understanding what is truly exposed to the Internet, what is accessible, uh, through the internet. And then what are threat actors trying to exploit today understanding threat intelligence and threat campaigns in the wild right now you could build a whole company off this context right now to get a base risk and this could be assessed as critical as an example. Going beyond that though, then to say, well, what are the strengths that I am getting already? I've purchased dozens of tools. I've spent hours and millions of dollars deploying them and configuring them. What benefit am I getting from a risk of vulnerability and mitigation from that today? So integrating with your network controls, your EDRs, your cloud controls to say, oh, I've already effectively been mitigating the risk of this specific vulnerability, um, so that brings it down to what we call the applicable risk, could be going from a critical to now a medium. So this is all context of one vulnerability doing this at scale across the million in your stack could have a real business impact to you. OK. But it turns out beyond just prioritization. GAI can have a really, um, is really effective at recommending actions you can take. And if you remember earlier I was talking about two types of actions, mitigation and remediation. And so what we can do is we can come in and say, not just for one vulnerability, but at scale, if I enable this one feature in my crowd strike, it can mitigate 55,000 plus findings across 500 plus assets, just as an example. Um, so that is something that you can do entirely within the security team without having to go to the IT infrastructure team, take action for it. But when it comes to patching and remediation. Typically a hybrid organization has tons of duplicate tickets across, you know, maybe your whiz on the cloud and tenable on-prem and sneak in the ASE. You've got all these duplicate tickets. If you can duplicate these to identify the one golden ticket that's going to patch and fix 100 to 1000 critical CVEs, auto assign it to the right user, that takes a ton of the manual work out of understanding how to operationalize these fixed workflows that can effectively reduce your meantime to remediation. So this is actually another great use case of how GAI can come in and understand that this is the one deduplicated ticket that you should be using to assign and map it to the right owner. So these are some really powerful uh deployments of how to take action against it. So I want to bring it all back up. I talked about this new operating model for a lot of our customers to me today, this is what it looks like. Sort of a three phased approach. A lot of folks have vulnerability findings fragmented across all those tools, right? First, come in, do good discovery, deduplication and normalization, a single source of truth of your vulnerability inventory. Then it goes to assessing what is your true exposure, right? This isn't a basic CBSS score. This is understanding what's in runtime, what is exposed to the internet, what are the asset are active threats in the wild that are actively trying to exploit this? What is the asset criticality, so I understand both the likelihood and impact of these vulnerabilities and very importantly. Am I getting credit? Am I taking into account in an automated way, the impact of the security defenses that I have already deployed, configured, and spent millions of dollars on? So understanding your strengths and how that's helping you prioritize is critical. And then of course mobilizing a response, auto assigning it to the right owner for patching or deploying mitigations to diffuse ahead of patch cycles, which really takes power back into the hands of the security teams, right? So this is a way to operationalize a modern threat exposure management program and what we see today. So it starts with having that really good data that underpins it. And really doing this in an automated way across a hybrid cloud on-prem and in the cloud environments. So what, so what, right? OK, all, all these features and technology, what does it get you? On average what we see from our from our customers today, you can de-risk 90% of critical vulnerabilities overnight. 90% of those vulnerabilities are effectively bullshit to you based on how you have deployed and configured your controls and what is in run time and internet exposed. But then we say, OK, well, here are the 10% that are likely to cause an incident. How do you quickly in an automated way mitigate and fix those? And there's a massive cost savings, of course you can get to really understand the ROI of your defenses, what's doing well for you today? how is that measured against all of your tools, and you can take a strategic lens to how you can optimize your security stack from that there. All right, but I want to now talk about an emerging practice that is very interesting. We're seeing in companies that are fairly mature on their threat exposure management journey because it kind of starts with sort of basic prioritization, and I'll I'll talk about a maturity model in a couple of slides, but this is an emerging practice for people who are getting further down that maturity curve. We call it proactive exposure hunting. Because attackers are moving very fast, as we saw earlier, there's a need to get a lot more proactive with these exposures. I'm going to share three case studies from our customer base, right? The first one is from a large hospital system. They were reading a lot about salt typhoon, right? You guys know this Chinese threat actor. They're they're very active these days, and they wanted to understand the basic question Am I exposed to salt typhoon? So because we map the vulnerabilities that these threat actors are known to exploit and we understand where you're exposed in your organization, it's a simple click to understand your exposure, build an exposure tracker and say, I want to reduce and eliminate my exposure to this threat actor, draw that down in this case over 2 days and track it and report out to your boss makes them look very good. Um, they read this on our weekly exploitation report. By the way, you can pop to our website, sign up for this. It's free. It comes out every week. It's very actionable for a lot of our customers. All right, the next case study is around a vulnerability. So we talked about a threat actor before. Now this is around what we call like a celebrity vulnerability that's in the news. You know your boss is going to ask you about this. Smart screen is in the news, right? So how do I come in and effectively understand my exposure and take an action to this? So being able to in one click say yes, I'm exposed and these assets. And then say, oh, but I actually have a mitigation available in this case in my Palo Alto firewall. If I enable this this rule, this IP block mitigation, I can effectively diffuse my exposure to this vulnerability overnight without waiting for patch cycles. So this is actually a role within the SEC opps org that someone's going in and assessing their exposure to these things. And the final one is around sort of control gaps, right? We talked about all these controls. How do you know if they're configured correctly? Last year we discovered a vulnerability called breaking WAF. It's sort of a WAF bypass exposure. You can come in and say, am I exposed to this at scale, and then find the domains and fix those. Within a couple of days, so these are the types of exposures, whether it's internet facing assets or vulnerabilities or threat actors that you can do in a more proactive way beyond just sort of the programmatic bulk remediation of vulnerabilities that I was talking about before. So this is an emerging practice we're seeing more mature organizations do. All right, this is the money slide right here. Uh, I got a few minutes left. I want to talk through this. We speak to hundreds of security leaders, full management professionals, and this is sort of the the four stage maturity model that they tend to fall into, right? So when we talk to people, we're asking them, where are you today and where are you trying to get to? And it often falls into one of these 4 stages or somewhere in between, um, and it breaks down into a couple of capabilities. How am I doing prioritization? Am I doing this exposure hunting right now and how am I doing my communication and and work flows around fixing vulnerabilities? Stage one is more of your scanning focus, right? They're not really doing much prioritization beyond basic CBSS, no exposure hunting right now, and it's a lot of manual work, spreadsheet hell, lots of emails to communicate these things to the right teams. Some of you, I can tell, are, are, uh, nodding along and resonating with this, uh, tons of manual work. Stage 2 is what we call basic prioritization. Yes, you're incorporating some threat intel into your privatization technology and your techniques, still mostly manual, um, doing some maybe basic hunting around critical vulnerability campaigns, lots of manual ticket assignment over to the IT teams as well. Stage 3 is what we call risk-based vulnerability management, right? This is where you're now incorporating a lot more threat intel and asset and business context to understand the likelihood and impact of vulnerabilities as they're they're released. You have maybe more defined processes for investigating critical volts and threat, and maybe you're doing automated ticket assignment through like an RBVM tool or maybe using like ServiceNow VR is a common one we often see um. Stage 4 is where a lot of people are trying to get to, but it's gonna be a multi-year journey, right? This is more of that continuous threat exposure management prioritizing by understanding truly what is a risk to me and my environment in an automated way, Internet exposure, runtime, understanding my defenses and how I've deployed and configured those today and how that impacts what is truly exploitable for me. Hunting is that sort of continuous proactive identifying and mitigating of those critical threats like those uh case studies I showed earlier and a lot more of automation around the ticketing and real-time dashboards to assess how our progress is on um on fixing these vulnerabilities. Alright, I got about a minute left. I'll just finish by saying, uh, you can really get actionable insights with a low lift using a tool like this, right? Uh, you can come in and these are these are agent list tools. You can come in and say within the first hour you're going to get this stuff deployed, connect to your whole stack, your scanners, your defenses, and you're going to get a lot of visibility within that first day. Full asset inventory with internet facing risks. Here are the biggest risks to my organization and here are the gaps in my security tools. And some quick wins on those mitigations. I can just deploy this one feature in my crowd strike that's going to mitigate 5000 vulnerabilities. And in the first week you're gonna be taking high impact actions, rapid remediation with that clear evidence embedded into the tickets, deploying the mitigations to diffuse thousands of vols across thousands of assets and fortifying your defenses across evolving attacks. All right, if everyone could just turn around, see that booth over there? It says Zaffranre exposure management for your hybrid cloud. We're right over there. If you want to see it in action or you want to just learn more about how customers are effectively deploying threat exposure management, uh, we'd be happy to chat with you, see Liam and Heather right there. Say hi, wave your everyone take a look. We're giving away some good stuff over there too. Um, thank you for the time. I got 5 seconds left, nailed the timing. Uh, come say hi to us. See you guys.
