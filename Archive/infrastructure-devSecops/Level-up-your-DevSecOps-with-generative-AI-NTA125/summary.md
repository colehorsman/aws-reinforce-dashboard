## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session (NTA125) demonstrates how Amazon Q Developer transforms DevSecOps by integrating AI-powered security capabilities directly into the software development workflow. Delivered by Ayman Isimwe, Solutions Architect at AWS, the presentation addresses the traditional challenges of security reviews that require manual processes, extensive time investment, and often occur too late in the development cycle.

The session emphasizes the shift from reactive security practices to proactive, real-time security integration within IDEs. Traditional security reviews involve manual code analysis, architectural understanding, scope definition, detailed reporting, and subsequent developer remediationâ€”a time-intensive process that creates bottlenecks. Amazon Q Developer eliminates these friction points by providing instant security scanning and automated test generation directly within development environments.

The core value proposition centers on two primary capabilities: real-time security vulnerability scanning during development and automated unit test generation with execution. The presentation includes a comprehensive live demonstration showing how developers can use slash commands (/review and /test) within Visual Studio Code to perform workspace-wide or file-specific security scans, receive detailed vulnerability reports with severity categorization, and accept AI-generated fixes. The demonstration illustrates the seamless integration that enables security to become an integral part of the development process rather than an afterthought, ultimately improving code quality, security compliance, and developer productivity.

## Key Points
- Traditional security reviews are manual, time-intensive processes that create development bottlenecks and occur too late in the software lifecycle
- Amazon Q Developer integrates directly with popular IDEs (Visual Studio Code, JetBrains) as plugins/extensions for real-time security capabilities
- Two primary security features: real-time vulnerability scanning (/review) and automated unit test generation (/test) with execution
- Security scans can target individual files or entire workspaces, with AI filtering for unsupported libraries and languages
- Vulnerability findings are categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational) with detailed remediation guidance
- AI-generated code fixes can be previewed, accepted, or regenerated based on developer preferences and requirements
- Automated unit test generation supports test-driven development practices by creating executable tests during development
- IAM managed policies (Amazon Q Full Access, Amazon Q Developer Access) provide granular security control for enterprise deployments
- Seamless workflow integration eliminates context switching between development and security tools
- Proactive security approach enables "shift left" practices by addressing vulnerabilities during coding rather than post-deployment

## Full Transcript

Hi all, good afternoon. Uh, welcome to this presentation. Um, we'll be talking about how you can level up your desake ops with, uh, Amazon Q developer, and in this presentation, I'll be talking about how you can incorporate your security and make it a core part of your software development journey. My name is Ayman Isimwe and I'm a solutions architect at AWS and um. This is what I plan to go over today in the agenda. I'll go through some of the customer challenges that Amazon Q developer can help you address, and I'll also talk about the solution that Amazon Q developer provides in terms of security, and I also talk about the solutions architecture behind this service, Amazon Q Developer, and we also have a live demonstration, you know, showing how, uh, you can use it within your IDE. And after that, we'll talk about some of the benefits and the outcomes that you can get out of uh Amazon Q developer, and we'll also discuss about the next steps. Yeah So, uh, to get us started, um, wanted to start discussing about the key challenges that our customers face, you know, when it comes to security and software development. So first and foremost, you know, there's uh that difficulty in being able to detect these security vulnerabilities, you know, while you're still writing your codes, still at the development stage, so, um. Traditionally for security reviewers, first they'll need to go over you know the whole security I mean code based to get a better understanding of what the code does and also try to understand the architecture as well, you know, to be able to perform the security review and uh and also be able to understand the scope and the objectives of that security review. So after doing that, uh, traditionally they would perform the security review manually and after doing that then they generate a documented a documented detailed report that they share with the developers and the developers use that documentation to address those issues, right? So that could be not only difficult to detect uh all the security vulnerabilities or. Loopholes that are within your codes. It also takes some time to be able to run the security review and also considering the amount of work that goes into either writing those tests manually, performing those tests and also addressing those issues, you know, it kind of like uh poses these challenges. So that's where Amazon Q developer comes in, right? Um, Amazon Q developer as a service, it does provide software development assistance using uh generative AI and it can, you can use it to chat with your code, uh, and it can also provide inline recommendation and inline completions and also generate. new codes and help you build new features. You can also scan your code for any security vulnerabilities using Amazon Q Developer and also make code improvements and upgrades and be able to patch all those security vulnerabilities. So for this presentation, I'll be focusing on the two main capabilities of Amazon Q developer. One being uh real-time security scanning during development and also automated unit test generation and execution using Amazon Q developer. So, uh, taking a close look at the AWS, um, architecture diagram of the service, uh, so the service does integrate directly with your, uh, preferred IDE whether it's uh Visual Studio code or Jera's IDE, and you're able to use that as a plugin or as an extension within your uh preferred IDE. So, um, what it does, it allows you to perform security scans on your source code and also generate unit tests and be able to run them while you're still developing, you know, at the development phase before you push your codes to uh to production or any other deployment platform. So this empowers developers to be able to address any concerns or any um security issues right away while they're still at the development phase, which could save them time. Uh, towards the end and also making sure that these security best practices is incorporated in their, uh, software development, uh, at their software development stage. So before I head to the demo, I just wanted to also highlight some of the um IEM managed policies that you can um have access to using Amazon Q developer. So it does provide a couple of uh fully managed IM um policies. One is Amazon Q, uh, full access. So this provides you with administrator level permissions to be able to uh manage user subscriptions for your developers that have access to your Amazon Q developer instance within your AWS environment. There's also um AWS or Amazon Q Developer Access. This one grants full user access for Amazon Q developer, so it gives you access as a developer to be able to chat with your code and use some of the features and capabilities of Amazon Q developer. So you can use these managed policies as the foundation of your security policies. You can't directly edit these, but you can use them as a foundation and write more policies around this if you want to have like more granular security control around your um your users. So now getting to the demo, so I've got a pre-recorded demo here. As you can see, so I'll be showing how you can use Amazon Q Developer within uh your IDE. So I have it installed here on a visual studio called IDE. Uh, so you'll need to download, it's an extension, and for you to have access to these agents that you can use, especially the ones that I mentioned that I'll be focusing on in this presentation, which is review and test. So you'll be able to have access to those in the chat section, uh, within your Amazon Q developer extension, within your IDE. So I have a sample code that I'll be using here in the demo. It's a simple, uh, Python application. Uh, and as you can see, I'm already signed in. So once you also download that extension, it gives you the ability to either sign in as a, uh, an individual user or as a, uh, an enterprise or organization, um, staff. So like I mentioned here, I have like a sample Python application that I'll be using for the demo and I have some uh files already open here, and uh to start, I'm gonna start with uh with the review, you know, that can uh help you run the. Yeah, that can help you run the security scan. So there are two ways that you can run the security scan. You can either run it for a specific file within your codebase, or you can run it on the whole project or your whole codebase or workspace. So to run that, you head to the chat section within your Amazon Q developer extension and type in slash review. I like I mentioned, it gives you a couple of options, review the workspace for the entire workspace or review the active file. So I go ahead and select active file to begin with. So what we'll do, I'll just um, run a security review for this open file that I have within my IDE. So, um, in, in the background, what Amazon Q developer is doing is uh assessing your code, and it does also apply some filters, you know, for any third party libraries that it doesn't support. It does, uh, filter them out and exclude those or any unsupported languages, programming languages that it doesn't support or any test codes. So as you can see, once it completes the security review, it now uh show all the security issues or code issues that it has found in the code issues window up here and it also grouped them in different uh categories based on the uh criticality. So issues with high criticality puts them in high, medium, low, and info as well. And for you to, uh, if you wanna have. Uh, get more information about any particular issue that he was able to find. You can just click on that particular issue, as you can see. And then uh if you click on the issue, there is a small magnifying icon towards the end of the, the, the issue name, and if you click on that, Within your IDE it should take you to um the issue details window, give you more details. So I'll go ahead and click on that. So once you click on that, it opens that in a new window called issue details, which gives you further detail information about that issue that was uh identified within your code. And it also shows you like which specific line of code that has that issue. And in addition to that, Amazon Q developer does provide you with a uh a suggested code fix that you can apply to your code. So you can choose to accept that fix or ask it to regenerate, uh, again, another recommendation and provide more guidance. So you can go ahead and click on accept fix once you've reviewed all those changes. As you can see, it also gives you like a deep view where you can see uh all the changes that it is about to make, you know, to be able to fix that issue. So you can go ahead and click on accept and then it goes in and just change your codes and address that issue, and it's uh it's gone from the code issues section. So that's how you can run security review on a specific file within your code base. So now we're going to see how you can run that on the whole project. Like let's say for instance you wanna be able to run the whole uh the review on your whole project so you go back to the chat section, but this time after typing in slash review, you choose review the uh the workspace. And then behind the scene it's gonna go and try to uh review each um file within your your code base. So it takes a while, a couple of minutes, depending on how uh complex and how huge your code base is. And once it completes, as you can see for this one, it did run for the whole project, so that's why it was able to um identify, you know, quite a few issues. So you'd be able to see all those issues in the code issues section and also uh under the problems uh section within your VS code, and, um, you can now navigate to this part and look at the whole list of issues that it has identified and you can click on each issue which will take you to that uh specific line of code. Within your code base where it has that issue and then you can choose to see more details on that issue and also um generate fix suggestion. Like now shifting gears, I want to uh show you how you can also generate unit test for your code base, you know, and uh this comes in helpful especially when you are uh developing in a uh test driven development and you wanna incorporate that at your development stage so um. Right here I'm gonna go to my um log in Python file. And there are two ways that you can generate unit tests for your code. First is by selecting portion of your code that you want to generate test for, right click Amazon Q and go uh choose an option to generate unit test. The other way you can do that is using testing agent within Amazon Q Developer. So you head to the, uh, chat section, type in slash test, and if you don't have any, uh, file open within your IDE, it will prompt you to select what file you want to generate unit test for. So as you can see, it goes ahead and generate unit test for that particular file that was opened, gives me a the file and um after reviewing security test that it has provided with me, I can accept it and as you can see as part of my project, it has created this uh test login file which has some uh tests. That I can run So if I head back to my terminal, I can run uh those unit tests that has been generated by uh Amazon Q developer. As you can see, I was able to uh pass the test that it has generated. So this is how you can generate um unit test and I've also showed you how you can uh run security reviews on your code all within your um software development workflow without leaving your IDE. So now getting back to the outcome like you've seen throughout this demo, uh, you're able to detect any security vulnerabilities or loopholes that were in a in a code using uh review capabilities and you're also able to generate unit test, you know, for uh for the codes right within your IDE. So this tight integration that saves time, you know, for uh developers and also. Make sure that your code is improved, the quality of your code, and the security compliance as well, and also enhancing the developers' productivity, you know, because they don't have to make testing or security review an afterthought, they can tightly integrate that within their software development life cycle. So with that, um, that brings us to the end of the presentation. So right here I have a QR code, you know, for people who might be interested in getting started with Amazon Q developer. Please go ahead and scan this QR code. I'll take you to the documentation page which has step by step tutorials on how you can install that in your preferred IDE uh within your AWS environment as well, enable that and start using it. So, um, that brings us to the end of the presentation, and I wanted to thank everybody for your kind attention. So, um, for any other question, I'll be at the new AWS stand, you know, if you have any specific question around Amazon Q developer and all these security features, please feel free to stop by and, um, and then I'll be able to address some of your questions. Thank you so much.
