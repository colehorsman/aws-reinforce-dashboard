## Summary
The presentation focuses on breaking down silos between security and infrastructure teams during cloud adoption, particularly in regulated environments. The speaker, Jessie Skibby from AWS, leads a team of assessors who help regulated customers accelerate their compliance outcomes and security governance at scale.
The key theme is implementing "guardrails versus gates" by translating non-technical control descriptions into technical implementations that can be automated through code. The presentation emphasizes the importance of aligning goals between infrastructure and security teams, especially given the complexity of global regulations (135+ privacy and data protection laws).

## Key Points
- Everything in a cloud environment is code, including security, risk, and compliance controls
- Infrastructure and security teams often have misaligned goals and KPIs that need to be harmonized
- Moving security "left" in the development process is crucial for regulated environments
- Organizations need to translate non-technical control descriptions into technical implementations
- Building bridges between infrastructure and security teams accelerates compliant cloud adoption
- Automated guardrails are preferable to manual security gates
- Collaborative approach ensures both security compliance and efficient infrastructure deployment

## Technical Details
- GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) Engineering implementation through code
- Three lines of defense model for security governance:
  - First line: Governance standards, policies, procedures
  - Second line: Security risk and compliance monitoring
  - Third line: Governance oversight and validation
- AWS Professional Services team specializing in regulated customer compliance
- Control automation services (mentioned but not detailed in transcript)
- Infrastructure pipeline integration with security controls
- Compliance-as-code implementation frameworks
- Security and compliance monitoring tools

## Full Transcript

Today we're gonna talk about breaking down silos between security and infrastructure and so I'm gonna assume that when you're looking through the session catalog and you see this title there may be may or may not be things that you're struggling with in your own cloud journey. Um, trying to find ways to incorporate security into the infrastructure pipelines like as you're trying to accelerate as fast as possible to cloud in a safe and secure way, so the one thing that the um. Session description really didn't say specifically, but we're we're talking about what works um in a regulated environment like how do you actually incorporate security into the plans that infrastructure has to migrate and do it in a safe way like go fast but do so in a very safe way and so my name is Jessie Skibby I'm gonna talk to you in another slide or two about who I am um I'm with AWS and um I lead a team. Of assessors and I'll talk about that in a minute but I also have uh Ajish and Akshay um with State Street and they're gonna come up on stage here in about 15-20 minutes and share a lot more insight on, you know, what's worked for them, how their operating model has changed, and a little bit more about their journey. So I'm really excited to get through my piece and then bring up the real stars of the show and have have them share their story with you so that you can put some real live scenarios with what I'm gonna take you through. So again, once we talk through, I, I gave the introductions. I'm gonna dive a little bit more into the team of uh people that I lead, but we're today in the 60 minutes we're gonna go through kind of talking about scalable security governance and how do you break down the silos between infrastructure and security to to build that out um we're gonna talk through some of the um. Management and governance services, so some of the services that AWS offers that may help you on that journey to scalable cloud governance and then we'll bring up our, uh, State Street. We have a director with uh infrastructure and one with security to talk about how they have uh been working together to build that scale for State Street. Alright, so I thought it was a little important to share about what I do, um, so I have been with AWS for a little over 6 years and I built a pretty unique team, um, within AWS so we provide professional services to customers that are migrating to the cloud, uh, we have helped somewhere around. I don't know 250 or so regulated customers over the years be able to accelerate their compliance outcomes, their security and governance at scale and so this is a little bit more about how we do that we're a global entity. Um, we, um, help customers adopt AWS services and we do that with a team of industry certified auditors like not a lot of people know that we have this entity where, um, we work with customers on their side of the shared responsibility model and we make sure that as they're adopting the cloud security governance can also happen at scale. So the concept of GRC engineering, um, everything in a cloud environment is code so think about how beneficial it is that you have all of your security risk and compliance controls as part of those pipelines and how that can help you build over time more of a guard rail versus a gate scenario where you have those controls and they're automa automatic. And so how do we, what do we really do? This is what's interesting when I was putting this session together I'm like, yes I can talk all day about what my team does how why do customers hire us like what do we really do, but what we really do is help build a bridge between infrastructure and security and what's interesting about this is that when I started. The team that I started 6.5 years ago, I was thinking about it from a compliance lens, right, but everything in a cloud environment is code, everything is technical, so how do you make sure that those very non-technical control descriptions and security outcomes that you have to meet, how do you turn those into very technical architecture and technical engineering implementations and when your infrastructure team within your organization is working really hard on their own transformation, right, going from an on-prem or going from. Um, a multi-cloud environment, how do you make sure that you're when you're going through this transformation, security and compliance are moved as far left like people say that it's actually achievable in a cloud environment like making translating those non-technical control descriptions to technical implementations and building those those guard rails over gates. And so why do we need to even build a bridge or why do we have to break down silos between infrastructure and security? Well, if you look at it through the lens of where behavior is driven by key performance indicators, goals and outcomes and if you think about what the infrastructure team. Really has to do like what are the most important things for the infrastructure team to do versus what is the security team focusing on right so unless in your organization you have aligned goals where the infrastructure team has very specific security targets and vice versa, there could be a misalignment a misunderstanding in that operating model. And so one of the things that we work to help our customers with is building that right operating model so that you have roles and responsibilities to find shared goals that can be understood by both teams and that's gonna help you move a lot faster so the infrastructure team may be focused on system up time. Um, and performance whereas security is, is thinking about protecting the organizational assets and not that these are directly conflicting, it's meant to show the reason why this it happens in a lot of organizations, right, because we really need to bring security into uh what the infrastructure team is doing. And so thinking about it from an overall governance model, this is a very busy slide. And if you're in a regulated environment this will be familiar to you in some capacity and so along the left we're talking about what what drives the compliance need what drives the security outcome need is laws regulations frameworks and alignment and. Oh by the way, this number that I came across the other day, there's like 135 different global privacy and data protection laws like just think about the magnitude. If you're in a regulated environment and you're doing business globally, there's a tremendous amount of pressure on you to make sure that what you're building in your cloud environment meets those regulatory requirements so that's kind of at the the top. So when you're in the regulated environment, one of the ways to accelerate is like I said, breaking down those walls between security and infrastructure, making sure they're working together under a similar governance structure. And so moving down because we're starting at the top, first line of defense going down. You have all kinds of things like your governance standards, your policies, your procedures then you identify your controls but you really haven't yet done the translation into the technical need right? so you understand what you need to do but how you're doing it and the tactical implementation has not been defined yet and so then you get into controls automation I'm gonna share with you a couple of the AWS services that you can actually leverage to automate some of those controls. And then you have security risk and compliance um. Performing that second line of defense and monitoring and at the very end of the 3rd line of defense of course is the governance and oversight, the verification, the validation things are in place and one of the great benefits of breaking down the silos between whether it's application team security team. Teams and infrastructure teams, one of the great benefit of doing that collaboratively is making sure that the code that you're implementing is also can be assessed right? so the entire cycle of governance risk and compliance can be automated as much as possible removing a lot of that manual effort from the process. And so one of the ways we think about this at AWS is security guardians and so I'm not sure if anyone's heard of security guardians we talk a lot about this publicly it's one of the ways that AWS scales and we found that leveraging the similar model within our customers is is something that will help our customers scale the same way it's helped AWS scale. So why doesn't security scale this slide right here is very pink slide. Describes kind of why when you're first going through your cloud migration journey or you're really working at scale um the product team human so the people on the left, those are all your builders your development teams your your people building um cloud architecture and then you have the central security team. So right in a regulated environment you have to go through like an absA process or some sort of final review of what the developers have built and you and the ratio may be 1 to 10 maybe 2 to 100 and what happens if you don't have security that scales then you get um. I should have been holding the clicker. You get this blocked right? if you don't think about how you're building security in from the start, your final uh gate. It's gonna be shut right not being able to move to production because you haven't met all the security controls and so I think this slide right here is probably everything like why should you break down silos between infrastructure you could you could put application teams in that sense as well and security. And so having security in uh the ideal situation is that you have a scalable model and this represents what we've publicly talked about as the security guardians model at AWS where you have more of a distributed security model where you have your central security or enabling uh a security guardian on the builder team that's able to connect directly with the security team. And understand what the requirements are for launch and so the idea is by the time you get to the central security team ASEC process you have what you need built in and you get through that process a lot faster. And so wrapping the governance model around this we do compliance to tell the story of good security and so if you have the right uh requirements understood and if you're central security or in your compliance teams are enabling your infrastructure teams then you get much faster throughput to production. That is the concept. So how can you accelerate in a regulated environment? So what's interesting is that I, uh, I lead a compliance team for AWS um the individual that hires us isn't usually security. That what we get hired and and um we get obviously requested by the infrastructure team and so my number one is invite security because if security isn't part of those initial planning sessions in your migration to cloud. Then we're not gonna be able to make this scalable structure together. Security needs to be invited in part of the conversation, um, talking about it earlier, um, with our customer that's gonna come on stage in a minute. You think about it like, uh, security being a product feature like whatever you're building, whatever the infrastructure team is building, we really need to think about security as a primary product feature that has to be there before launch and then creating shared goals between security and infrastructure driving clarity. Because there has to be clear goals and shared goals that the teams are working towards to drive the right behavior. Um And then adapting security traditional security frameworks to cloud native environments, um, this non technical to technical translation, um, is harder than you think. I think if anybody in this room has done this, like how do you take a control that talks about well I mean encryption of data at rest might be easy, but some of them are less easy. And so you have to be able to do the work of translating those requirements into the deployable code or maybe service by service level uh configuration guidance so that as a security team hopefully most of you in the room are security teams this is a security event the idea is that you're you're doing this translation and you're empowering your infrastructure and applications teams to be successful. Because that would be the way that they would look at security as an enabler to the accelerated cloud migration. And then incorporating it into an agile infrastructure deployment mechanism it has to be a part of the pipeline. It has to, you know, security, uh, compliance has the ability to be part of that pipeline and so things like policy as code can prevent something from launching and that's your, your proactive security control. Speaking of security controls. Um, hopefully your, your organization is not operating entirely in spreadsheets and um, hopefully your organization is not operating with screenshots as evidence because we've graduated from that in the cloud environment. There is a lot of uh opportunities to advance from that and and really move on you still need the control requirements but the way you translate them is what I'm gonna talk about next, including how the control is tested. So here's an example of how what it looks like in control tower as I I think of control tower as um think about like a first line um opportunity to say here are the. Um, the policy, uh, checks that I want to have every time this infrastructure is deployed, so this is an example here of limit network access and within control tower you can apply managed controls again we've done a lot of the legwork for you translating. The non-technical to technical within control tower so you have preventative controls proactive controls detective controls and so this is one way that security can help do this translation make sure those are in place so that infrastructure is enabled to deploy this and the business outcome is that you safely control through Internet access from AWS in this case of limit network access. And then also on the control tower dashboard you can see at a high level how many controls have been uh implemented and how many detective controls proactive controls so this is just an example of one of the AWS services that can help you in how you scale um security through your infrastructure teams. Uh, control tower now has 760 controls available to you. And covering 75 services and 15 control objectives. Now a managed control if you're not familiar with that. That is a control that AWS of course manages. We also do the mapping for you, so if this 253 is in scope for you or PCI DSS, these managed controls have we've done the translation, the technical to non-technical translation for you. So when you go into control tower and select these, um, you can do so by the non-technical control, which is really nice. And of course it's super important to think about with everything with security it's about how many walls or obstacles do you put up, you know, having the right detective preventative and proactive controls uh available through control tower is should be a part of your strategy. And then business outcomes that you really wanna get to and again it's it's, it seems like some extra work to do in the very beginning but think about it in the in the sense of taking the time. To plan and make sure that non-technical to technical controls can be translated, you've empowered infrastructure teams with what they need to be successful thinking in terms of guard rails over gates right? don't want to be the department of no and security. You want to understand how you can enable and so. Things that we see when customers do this well are reduction in errors, reduction in costs, reduction in time even though it may take you a slightly more time in the beginning of your journey, the the scalable impact is huge. To be able to address new requirements like I did I mention there are 135-ish different laws and regulations that are continuously changing the agility in the organization to make these changes has to be scalable. All right, with that, I would love to invite, uh, Ajish and Akshay up to the stage. They would have graciously agreed to share a little bit more about State Street and the journey that they have been on in working together and I'll let you guys introduce yourselves. And go ahead and get started. Hi, good afternoon. This is Akshay, and I'm responsible for cloud platforms at the bank. Hey, I'm Agee George. I manage security architecture and engineering at State Street. Thank you, Jessie. Um, let me give you a quick overview of State Street in general, and then we'll dive into some of the best practices and some of the things we have done, uh, in our multi-cloud journey. Uh, State Street is a 230 year old bank headquartered in Boston. We are one of the 8 GSIBs in the United States. GSIB is a global, globally systemically important bank, right? And if you look at this chart here, we manage, we have about 46.7 trillion with a T, assets under custody and administration, right? That kind of equates to about 11.5% of the world's assets. So think about the scale that we operate in, right? And so security is so paramount because we are a custodial bank and hence the fiduciary responsibility we have is very, very important to us, right? And to and to be able to uh make sure the trust our clients put in us, um, security is paramount, extremely, extremely important, right, at at this scale. Uh, we are not a retail bank. A lot of people come to me and say, hey, we didn't, we, we don't see state Street all over the place like JPMC or Wells Fargo or Bank of America. We are, we are a bank which serves institutional investors. So our product lines are more into, uh, you know, investment servicing, investment management, wealth management, as well as, um, uh, global markets and financing. So we do service most retirement funds, pension funds, uh, you know, insurance companies, asset managers, so on and so forth, and that's why, uh, you don't see us all over the place, right? I just wanted to make sure that's clear because I often get that question. Also, because we are a GCP or a GSI bank, uh, we are too big to fail, like Citibank or any other, any other large banks in the United States. Because of we being a GSIP, we have extra supervisory controls which are required for us to adhere, including can we absorb more loss? How do we resolve ourselves, example, when Lehman went down, there's this whole problem because Lehman was so interconnected with the economic infrastructure of the, you know, globally. That people didn't know how to recoup and how to resolve. So resolvability is so important, and that's another factor. So we being a GE, there is extra focus on us in terms of the heightened security and risk management practices that we have to adhere to. Uh Getting to the next chart, um. Cloud and AI, I have to say AI because AI is all over the place. Cloud and AI are sort of cornerstones of our technology strategy in general, and the strategy is, uh, driven primarily to reduce risk, significant risk reduction, resiliency, and more importantly, uh, drive agility and innovation, thereby bringing more products services to the global investment community as well as to our clients. Uh, that's, that, that, that's key of our strategy. Uh, we have adopted a multi-cloud strategy, as you would imagine, with 22 hyper scales, and I would say the third one as well, because we are dependent upon the IBM mainframe, which I call the first cloud. So that's another cloud we have, not only AWS and Azure, but even the IBM mainframe being one of the cloud providers, right? That's how I look at it. Nonetheless, we have a multi-cloud strategy and what we are doing right now is we're in the midst of a multi-year journey to transition to the cloud. To operate at this scale, we run probably about 60+ data centers and 2,000+ applications and about 6 to 7 different landing zones across clouds today just because of the nature of the scale and the opportunistic way some of these clouds have spurned in the bank because of mergers, acquisitions, etc. uh, we have to make sure that we are able to manage the cloud sprawl as well. And to that effect, uh, we have taken a cloud center of excellence approach. A lot of you will be familiar with that. And with that approach, we look at sort of the cloud Center of Excellence in three work streams. Uh, the cloud platform engineering team, which many of you may be, may be, uh, part of the cloud Business Office looking at more governance yops and things like that, training, enablement, etc. and the last aspect is a cloud leadership team, which really drives governance and cloud strategy, right? Um. Interestingly, uh, some, uh, our, our core cloud landing zones, uh, we have like 6 or 7 landing zones. Few of them have come through acquisitions and they were built opportunistically, but the core landing zones we have where most of our applications migrating to, uh, the, the basic principle of those landing zones is self-service and to drive developer autonomy. And my friend here would kill me if I didn't say that we want to drive autonomy, but with guard rails so that people don't fall off the track, right? And that's where uh Aj and his team come into the picture where we partner together and we always look at cloud being a product. Right, it's a product platform centric mindset where if I'm the product owner of the cloud, I look at security being a feature of the product and not being a separate uh conversation at all. So the whole point Jesse was trying to make is invite security. I don't invite security because in my mind, he is part of our Agius's team is part of what we deliver to our customers collectively. Whether they are internal customers or external doesn't really matter, right? Uh, so that's, that's key. We look at cloud as a, as a platform as a product. One thing we have done is because of the scale and the fact that we have 7 different landing zones, we've adopted something called a cloud capability model or a cloud platform model. Which is divided into like 8 or 9 domains and subdomains and the the reason we did that was because we needed a common business language to talk across AWS across Azure, across our own landing zones because we have about 3 in Azure and 3 in AWS, right? It gives us a common capability model to talk about capabilities and maturity of those capabilities as a common language across clouds, right? And that's also the intersection point of how the security teams work with us, because if you look at a cloud, right? Literally, you, it's like a virtual data center. You, you have so many dials and knobs to tune and turn. You don't know which one to turn, which one to not turn. It's like you're sitting in a cockpit of a 787 and you're trying to figure out, hey, what should I do, right? Because you have to tune so many different things and configure so many things in the cloud, right? And hence it's very important for us to have a structured approach in terms of how we look at cloud capabilities in general, including all the security capabilities. Identity and access management, network segmentation, data loss prevention, and so on and so forth, there, there are many more, right? And so the cloud platform model gives us a structured approach where we have a common business language or capability language to talk through and figure out how capabilities, including security capabilities, are maturing in our different landing zones, right? That's key. Uh. I think one of the other things Jesse brought up was, like I said, we, we, we look at like cloud as a product, and we look at also our cloud landing zones as an application. And as soon as you think about that as an application, the conversation changes. Why? Because you could look at a cloud team where the cloud team is 1-800-Akshay, can you provision a VM for us versus we saying, hey, here is a service catalog of services, go use it, don't worry about it. You don't have to call me. Just use it in a self-service model, but I want to assure that all the different aspects of controls are all built in, so, you know, nothing will go wrong and we know the, the sort of the, uh, you know, contours of what people can do and cannot do, right? The other aspect is. Uh, while we looked at the cloud platform model, it was very important for us to, to sort of baseline our cloud control framework, right? So what we did was we looked at the cloud Security Alliance's cloud control matrix 4.0, which is what we have baselined as our cloud cloud controls framework, right? And that's what we follow and adhere to across all our landing zones. That, that's another key element of that. As far as policy code is concerned, uh, Jesse spoke about it. We, we, whether it's Azure, we use Azure policy, or if it's AWS we use a combination of control tower, AWS config, SAPs and OPA policies to ensure that we deploy preventative detective as well as proactive controls, right? But the philosophy we use is we want to prevent as much as possible and shift left rather than detect and then do policing later on, right? So the more you prevent, the better you are essentially, right? Uh Jesse talked about security guardians, which I think Ajish and Ajit will have a little more add color on, is security guardians have to be part participating both within the app site as well as in the platform site because we look at platform as an app as well, because everything is through code. Right? Nothing is click-offs. We don't allow click ops in our environment. We want to make sure everything is in Git and everything is deployed as a pipeline, as codes, so we can go back to it. Nothing is configured with click ops in general, unless there is a break glass scenario, of course, right? Uh, with that, let me transition to Ajish and then we can have ourun. Sure, so as Akshay explained, our organization is on a multi-year transformational journey, uh, trying to migrate from an organization that's majority deployed on premise to an organization that's majority deployed on the cloud, right? Uh, as security we've been going through a lot of transformations ourselves, right? We started this journey 34 years ago, insourcing a lot of security capabilities, building out key security functions, modernizing a lot of the technology and processes so that we can bring more modern, more industry standards security. Abilities to bear to protect the enterprise that Akshay talked about hey we're we're managing a lot of risk for the global financial system. So how do we make sure that that's done in a measured way, in a way that our regulators can take comfort with that we can evidence, uh, readily and regularly, uh, as we're called to do often. Uh, so a lot of the cloud migration for us was figuring out how to work with the various stakeholders, right? We've gone through a lot of evolution in this space. We started with, as Akshay mentioned, a, a very disconnected cloud world, right? We had, you know, different or suborgan organizations maintaining their own. And cloud footprints we partnered with uh our cloud leadership team to bring them all under centralized governance. We worked as a security team to make sure that we had standards that were mapped to frameworks that we adhere to so and made sure that they were in turn aligned to frameworks like CCM. That were adopted by the CLT we worked to make sure that those requirements were translated into meaningful requirements for the teams that were implementing systems in the cloud, and we wanted to make sure that as many of the requirements were shifted left as far as possible, so we wanted to make sure that you know we had security by design and default in all of the landing zones that were coming up so we set about working with each of the platform teams. Yeah to get our security engineers indexed with folks that were designing policy as code designing the landing zones, designing the services that would be enabled we set about making sure that the services that were turned on would be hardened on day one. We wanted to make sure that we had logging monitoring in place, right? As a security organization we had to evolve too, right? We started changing from models where. You know, we had a sim in a corner, a couple of ops people, uh, chasing compliance issues with various tools to one where we started aggregating the broader picture of the attack surface, the broader picture of logs and threats that were emerging in this space and bringing holistic views together so our operations teams, our engineering teams, uh, could partner with application owners, cloud platform leaders to take timely action. Action against these issues, uh, so this has been an ongoing and evolving journey, right? And as we work with the cloud platform teams, our operating model with them has evolved as well, right? We as security, you know, started in a place where, hey, uh, we, we have a lot of infrastructure across the organization, uh, everything from traditional mainframes to mid ranges, uh, that were. In Vogue 50 years ago to cloud native digital architectures and for us, you know, the security of all of it is important we look at the cloud as an opportunity rather than as a risk. I've seen a lot of my colleagues in security, you know, call up, hey cloud, how are you gonna manage all the risk? How do you see all of the problems and threats in the cloud? Uh, I actually see it as an opportunity in the sense that cloud gives you unparalleled visibility. and unparalleled control at the fine grained level in terms of what you deploy, what you can log, what you can observe what you can monitor what you can respond to, and it gives us the ability to take security frameworks and build a level of automation and orchestration that you could not do in a traditional sys admin managed on premise environment so we are in the process of maturing. Our security posture, making sure that all of this uh. A new capability gets indexed with our security requirements gets us to a place where we not only have this visibility, but we also have that control and we can take the friction away from the application teams and the platform teams and allow the organization to innovate at a faster pace. at a faster pace and get to a position where security and compliance doesn't become an afterthought doesn't become a hey somebody's chasing us to go do this, so I better uh but rather that's something that's embedded into the products that we deliver. Yeah. I'm gonna go back to something really quickly because I, I wanted first of all just thank you both for being willing to share some of your story and to answer some questions for all of us but I just 53,000 employees worldwide at State Street like this is no easy task, you know, cloud migration and changing of behaviors. And moving through what the two of you have moved through over the past couple of years together is pretty incredible so I just wanted to highlight that from just a sheer magnitude perspective, but I actually have a question for the audience that I wanted to ask first, um, how many of you are on a security team today kind of going through some of this? You're on security, so Akshay, you're significantly outnumbered in this room, um, and so we are part of the same family. We deliver products together. Yeah, I just wanted to kind of see, so how many of you are, are, are kind of going through this struggle in a regulated environment today? OK, good. We're, we're definitely gonna be on the side over here answering questions, uh, at the end. So I just wanted to share there if we don't get through, I'm, I'm have some questions for the two of them. I went too far. Um, but if there's something that we don't address, I, I wanna welcome you at the side at the end. Um, alright, so the reason why we have two trains leaving the station it's because I kind of think of the two of them cloud migration starts, 2 trains leave the station. Do they go in the same direction? Does one go off over here? The concept here is that you know we can't we have to get there together and get there fast and get there safely and so doing that in an accelerated way requires deep partnership with security and your infrastructure, your applications team. Um, alright, so I wanted to ask, I know, um, Akshay, you talked a little bit earlier about the operating model. I, I wanted to ask both of you how has the operating model between the two changed, right? I know we talked about how it is today, but how, what would you say to people in the audience that are struggling with this today? Maybe some key lessons learned and why you knew the operating model had to change. And take it first? Sure, I think, uh. Every time when you, when we really started our structured cloud journey, we, I mean, we had cloud landing zones being built from like 2017, right? 2017, and we really started structuring it appropriately around 2022. I think there's a time which comes where you have to realize and recognize that if you want to achieve things at scale, uh, something needs to change. And what needs to change is a big question, and that's driven through how the organizations are structured and the, the, the influence barriers that there and the friction which is already there, and how do you circumvent that? Why? Because often what people don't realize it, realize is if you look at our firm, we have 2,000+ applications, right? So it's not that you switch a button and everything goes to the cloud the next day. You have to be in a transitional period for 5 or 6 years before everything can get to the cloud, and that's the journey we are on. During that transition, there are going to be assets which are going to be on-prem in a hybrid model. They're going to be on the cloud, and we still have to protect all of them. And you can't just say, I'm going to do policy ascort in the cloud, but on-prem I don't care. Because I don't care because they're still driving revenue streams for you. So the operating model has to literally change uh as you transition, as you mature through the journey, right? And part of the, part of the transition operating model in my mind fundamentally is two or three things. One, we as leaders always want to do shift left, shift, left, shift left, right? shift more to the left. What are the developers saying? How much am I going to do? Because my business wants to prioritize business feature functions more than security. And resiliency. It's just not security. There's a resiliency aspect as well. How do you train the organization and the development community and the product owners where they consider security as a business feature function? That's fundamental to me because if you really need to get into a model where you're agile, you are running fast at a faster pace and with velocity, that's the mindset you need to have with the product owners that security and resiliency is an integral feature equivalent to a business feature function. I think that's fundamental. My mind. So shift left can be only driven if you get to that point of people understanding that security is a part of what you're doing. Second aspect then is the engineering culture and the mindset, very, very important, right? Like Aje mentioned, I, when, when we started our journey, uh. You know, some of our clouds were built by traditional systems admins and I'm not saying good or bad, uh, over a period of time, what we recognized was we need to treat application landing zones as applications, right? So I was moved. I never, I never did infrastructure in my life, by the way. I did that only like since the last 4. Years I was an app developer. So I moved in from the application development organization to start doing infrastructure infrastru code because for a lot of the systems admins infrastru code and git and pipelines was, yeah, I don't know what you're talking about, right? It's, it's a it's a different mindset, right? So to be able to think that way and bring and induce that engineering culture, we had to make that change, uh, where we had need to have leadership who have been engineers, right? I think that's the second fundamental change in my mind. The third aspect of the operating model I am seeing now evolving within the bank is more focused on synaps. Very, very important because often in large banks or even large organizations, uh, we are not very cost conscious because we don't see the cost. The cost transparency, uh, you know, is, is equally important. Purely from a security perspective, I would say the capability model that we created that we had a common definition between all of us is allowing. Us to look at things in a more structured manner and that's allowing the shift where some of the security, security engineers are now part of our collective teams. We don't think infrastructure and security being two different teams, two different trains. This is one train which needs to tackle the hybrid environment and the transitional environment that we are in right now, right? So these trains has to be thought about as one train. Running security like a team sport and that's just my view on some of the aspects. Can I, can I shift gears just a teeny bit because I feel like Ajish what you have to say will speak to some of the room and you're looking at me like what is she gonna do? Um, I'm thinking about because I, I, I bet all of you that raised your hand like I'm on a security team today and you may be struggling. Um, what, what was key in your building your relationship with Okshay because I, I, I bet you everybody in the room wishes they had an infrastructure partner like Akshay. Is there anything about the in the building of this operating model that you think was helpful in in get building that relationship with infrastructure? I think if I reflect on where we started and where we got to right like some of the key challenges where where we started as a security organization was very compliance oriented organization right where we are now is uh. An organization that prioritizes having empathy for the consumers of our security services, right? Like we are engineers, you say that again having empathy for the consumer of your security services, exactly. So we tend to look at things from the perspective of the application developer, the platform developer. I've been an application developer. I've been a platform developer for 25 years. I, I think I used AWS's first versions when they came out in 2011, so. Uh, so we've been doing this for a long time. So from the consumer side, if you go look at the security problem, does somebody deploying an application in your cloud environments understand what the security requirements are, right? Can they, you know, translate, uh, the, the vast repositories of standards that most organizations have sitting around into something that are real tangible like policies like code deployment pipelines like. Rules that they can actually integrate into their development practices, right? And how are you as a security team enabling them to do that, right? We started partnering with our cloud platform teams to start doing a lot of that translation. We brought folks into our security organization that were cloud engineers that were DevOps folks, right? We started building things on the cloud ourselves. We transitioned our SIM and other platforms into cloud of lake houses and, you know, large scale distributed. Systems so we were not just the police for the cloud we were also first party clients for all the cloud services, right? We had the need to be deployed globally we had the need to scale everywhere so we saw firsthand the impacts of a poor operating model in terms of managing security. We wanted to make it easier not only for the application teams are out there but also easier for ourselves to consume and innovate cloud services. Right, so this aligned the incentives for us, right, and helped us to speak the same language, right? Hey, how do we make this simple? How do we make this easier? Because at the end of the day we both have to go up together, explain to our executives, explain to our regulators how we are producing a secure compliant platform at stage. I think I just like to add one more thing. The other key thing in my mind beyond inducing the engineering talent and everything else is also transparency. And the fact and the notion that red is not bad. So if I'm a cloud team and I'm an infrastructure team and I'm trying to enable services, I need to participate and be transparent with Ajj in terms of how do we solve these problems. Yeah, I don't know hide. It's, it's us. It's one team, one problem. So red is not bad. If it's red, fine, we'll find a solution to that. It's not I'm gonna hydrate till the point that, you know, it becomes transparent. Transparency is equally important, which builds the trust in the teams, right? And that, that, that's another key thing at least from my perspective. Yeah, I wanna highlight too I think one of the keys to both of you being such powerful champions in your organization is that you do have the engineering background that you're bringing to your role. So I, I, I guess I my, my advice to anyone in a traditional security team you're not thinking about it from what I loved what did you said about um making sure you have empathy for what the infrastructure team needs and if you're not focusing on how do you how do how does that translate in the technology is it how what is the. Code that they need to help them, you know, how do you translate that technical I'm sorry, non technical to technical requirement focusing on security, not compliance, not compliance as a check box activity but true threat modeling and security and making sure infrastructure has what they need to go fast. That's the only way to go fast and and stay safe at the same time. I'll add another anecdote on that right like uh sometimes as security teams we have the tendency to really just look at any security issue as a big issue and chase all things, you know, homogeneously, right? What we've had to do was like take a step back and say what is really important to your point about. modeling, right, like, hey, for a particular piece of red that gets surfaced, right, what are the issues, what are the impacts, right? What actually gets affected? What is at risk of loss here and really peel back because we have to understand back to the empathy point, right, that we cannot solve every compliance check box issue with the same priority. Something that's an urgent security issue that might lead to actual data loss, actual compromise of the environment, so we took a stand on, you know, really prioritizing issues that we were seeing in these cloud environments from the lens of operations, from the lens of active threats, and saying, hey, these things that present immediate and present danger to the bank, we will address first. We will focus the limited. Capacity that our platform teams and application teams have on fixing those issues first compliance we'll get to it right? We have SLAs for everything but you know what is important like figuring out as an organization what is critical versus what is important for compliance is going to be important for denoising the world of cloud security issues for you. And that's again where we also partner because it's not applying the risk lens to what is material and what is non-material. It's also playing around well with our other organizations like the lines of defense because, uh, you know, me and Ajeesh can agree on certain things, but end of the day it's a collective one where all the lines of defense, us as engineers, our risk management team and the audit team all need to be on the same page and apply the same lens because otherwise then you create another conflict. So in my mind. Education on cloud risk and controls across the board is equally important. It's just not security infrastructure. We need to bring other participants in as well, including legal and procurement. So just wanted to highlight that as well. Yeah, I just, I wanted to highlight, uh, 230 years of experience like this doesn't change overnight. I think you. You touched on it education um and if if those of you that don't know about cloud Audit Academy, it's a really great program there's some free e-learning um available through training and certification specifically focused on those that are doing cloud audit. Uh, and, and need to understand because it education doesn't reach all the depth sometimes within a large organization that it should because even though the two of you are aligned you may have somebody on the audit team who hasn't been brought up to speed on cloud and how to look at things in a cloud environment so that's a free resource if that's help. I wanna talk about uh tooling because I know I talked earlier we we talked a little bit about some control tower implementation but in a multi-cloud environment like tooling has been really key for you to get to this point in your journey so don't know who wants to start, but let's talk about tooling or AWS services that you're finding value in. I can start off on this one, so you know. To the point about multi-cloud, right, uh, we, we have used as much as possible of the individual CSPs tooling, right? So we, we set about solving security problems as a whole, right? We, we look at everything from application security to platform security, cloud security, uh, our logging, monitoring incident response capabilities and take a holistic view of how do we. A these core security capabilities in each of these cloud environments. The approach we took was really to start synthesizing central panes of glass for security issues across our cloud environments. We leaned into AWS Native as your native security tools started there. How do we enable basic alerts, basic monitoring on those tools? How do we look at basic compliance requirements. Within these pipelines, how do we centralize all that information so that we can produce consolidated visibility for the organization as we look to resolve this consistently across all environments so we use tools that map across both our cloud and on premises environments and and we started bringing those issues in and use it as a central funnel to send issues not just to the platform teams and application teams that. Need to partner with to resolve those issues but also to our operations organizations that are responsible for ensuring the operational security of those environments and you know we've we've gone beyond the cloud, so to speak we we look at this as the way security is going right because of the number of platforms and environments that are proliferating and the number and degree of technical control you need to have over each of them having these central planes. Of glass that give you centralized visibility, uh, allow you to take a more continuous controls monitoring approach so we integrate AWS native tools, uh, like Guard duty, like Security Hub, like, uh, compliance I'm sorry, audit yeah audit manager, yes, that's it. Sorry, I get lost in the, uh, jargon soup of uh cloud tools as well as Gartners. On a regular basis, so we've taken an approach where we normalize all of this data we use tools like Jupiter one to paint a similar picture about cloud and on-premise environments, and then we use that to provide visibility to our executives to our audit functions about the health of these environments and our controls maturity in these environments, um, and that's helped us uh navigate the sprawl in space of cloud tools, right? Awesome. Yeah, I, I think Ajee covered it, but I just want to also highlight that. It's also sometimes fundamentally very important like in our case, in our journey, we have to define what multi-cloud means to us. But sometimes people think multi-cloud means that you can deploy the same asset across both clouds, and that's multi-cloud, right? So from our perspective, and it's also very sometimes we think these definitions are clear and everybody understands it, but I can guarantee you if you say what is multi-cloud and I give each of you a paper, everybody will have a different view of multi-cloud means, right? So I mean, a structured way. Thinking just so that we bring people together is what does multi-cloud mean to you, right? Multi-cloud to us means we are always multi-source so we can manage the concentration risk, right? So we always have two clouds. Now, multi-cloud does not mean to us that we are cloud agnostic, that we can deploy the same asset across two clouds. So our cloud architecture is more single cloud core versus multi-cloud core where one application is deployed only in one cloud and not on both clouds. You could do that with the cost and the operational challenges all of you are aware of is not meaningful. The reason I brought this up is because from a multi-cloud perspective, there's always this aspiration, uh, you know, everybody has not only the security teams, but even our firewall teams and other teams to always have a single pane of glass across like 7 things, right? Some cases that's possible, some cases that's not. And it's always a constant debate and discussion between us in terms of what capabilities make sense to be cloud agnostic and what capabilities we have to use from the cloud provider, because in my mind, the cloud providers are also spending billions of dollars of investments into the tooling they are building. And if I'm on the cloud, I don't want to use cloud as a, as a sort of a data center, virtual data center. I want to leverage the capabilities of the cloud provider. To the right, so there's always this debate. Some cases like Ajeesh Pension, CSPM, and others, we have taken a more cloud agnostic approach, even on firewalling, etc. between Azure and AWS. On the other cases, we are our general philosophy is if the capability is very mature on the cloud, we tend to use that as much because usually a lot of those capabilities are too much intertwined with all the other cloud constructs within the cloud. So we don't want to create abstractions on top because it's difficult to maintain, manage, and sustain those, those abstractions. But in certain cases it makes sense, which is where, you know, Ae highlighted that areas where we use cloud agnostic tooling. Yeah, this is where we look at security as a product portfolio, right? So we're looking at components that feed into a macro product. We're looking at security like not just within each of these cloud landing zones, but security as things come back into our on-premise environment. Security as things go across clouds. Security as our identity infrastructure, uh, you know, aligns and attaches to each of these pieces of cloud tooling as each of these applications that are deployed in multiple different patterns across the, the, the fabric of our multi hybrid cloud architecture as they're launched out, how does security really transit and transverse all of these different environments and how do we build a product that captures those security requirements and what components do we build? What components do we ad. Opt that are cloud native, uh, what components do we get from vendors and cobble together what makes sense from a product architecture perspective? I like this security as a product or security as a product feature, you know, takes security out of the cost center bucket and moves it into another bucket. Anyway, I, I, I wanted to thank you both again for your willingness to share your story. I know you're still in the middle of it. You're, you're working towards greater and greater maturity every day, um, I wanna. To share a little bit more information with those of you in the audience if you'd like to connect with me and my team that's the center barcode um if you wanna learn more about control tower that's the barcode on the far left and then all of our AWS managed, uh, management and governance services oops I guess I could go back there for a second. So there that's some more resources for you and then like I mentioned we're gonna conclude this part, but we'll be over here on the right would love to answer any of your questions and hope to connect with you outside the event. Oh, thank you.
