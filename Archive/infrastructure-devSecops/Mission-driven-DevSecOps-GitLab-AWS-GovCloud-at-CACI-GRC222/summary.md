## Summary
This AWS re:Inforce 2025 session (GRC222) presents a customer success story from CACI, a government systems integrator, showcasing their DevSecOps transformation using GitLab and AWS GovCloud. Delivered by Lee Fowles, Global Field CTO at GitLab, the presentation focuses on how CACI moved from a fragmented security approach using 18 different tools to a unified platform strategy that prioritizes security culture and compliance automation.

The session emphasizes CACI's shift from point-in-time security testing to a "security-first" culture where security considerations are embedded throughout the development lifecycle. Rather than treating security as a separate phase that occurs after development, CACI implemented a transparent, conversation-driven approach that enables developers to understand and address security issues during development. This cultural transformation was essential for their mission-critical government work, where compliance is not just a checkbox but requires auditable, repeatable processes with clear attestations.

A key aspect of CACI's success was leveraging AWS GovCloud to accelerate their Authority to Operate (ATO) process for handling classified and mission-critical applications. By building on AWS's already-proven, hardened infrastructure, they avoided the lengthy approval processes that would have been required for custom data center implementations. The combination of GitLab's unified DevSecOps platform running on AWS GovCloud enabled them to create reusable, certified automation assets that could be quickly deployed across multiple projects while maintaining strict compliance requirements.

## Key Points
- CACI transformed from using 18 disparate security tools to a unified GitLab platform for end-to-end DevSecOps visibility
- Implemented "security-first" culture focused on transparent conversations rather than shifting security ownership to developers
- Leveraged AWS GovCloud to accelerate ATO processes for top-secret and mission-critical government applications
- Created reusable, certified automation components and templates to ensure consistent compliance across all projects
- Moved from point-in-time security testing to continuous security scanning integrated into the development workflow
- Achieved 90% savings in labor and administrative overhead through pattern-based automation
- Realized 13x faster security scanning by running scans on code diffs rather than entire codebases
- Successfully delivers fixed-price government contracts on time and on budget with automated security processes

## Full Transcript

Alright, so this particular session, voice of a customer, this is uh government systems integrator. Their name's Casey, uh CACI, um, I've heard it pronounced both ways, both from the CTO as well as our board of directors, so I guess either one is fine for the session. Um, what we're gonna talk about is a little bit about their security journey. And um I had the opportunity to be able to sit down with the CTO we were at a conference together uh in Canberra in um Australia and it was very interesting the way that he walked through this journey because a lot of times when we sit down and we think about choosing tooling we look at tooling based on features. And one of the biggest things for Casey was they were trying to instill a culture around secure by design or a security first mentality. So my name is Lee Fowles. I've been with Gitlab for almost 4 years. Um, uh, I'm a global field CTO. I go around talking to executives, understanding what their challenges are. Security is top of mind with almost every executive that I talked to. Um, knowing that not every project that you have needs top level security, but usually there's somewhere between 30 to 50% of applications. There's some level of security that needs to go into that, whether that's securing, uh, making sure that secrets aren't going. Going into your projects whether it's SA scanning software composition analysis, uh, wanting to do salsa, whatever those things are, that's where that culture was really trying to come in. How do we do that without friction? So Anybody who has ever worked with public sector DOD knows that compliance is top of mind. And compliance, as I learned doing some regulated industry work uh in insurance is not always just about being able to say that you've done it. You actually need to have the ability to be able to point back to, uh, actual attestations to be able to show that you're doing it and you're doing it in a repeatable fashion. Now when it comes to software and building mission critical software for the government. One of the items that Casey ran into was the other security tooling that they had been using was sort of point in time, so a developer would go write a whole bunch of code. And then what would happen is is it would go through a QA process and only when QA said, hey, everything looks good did they come back and did they go through and do a security test and a lot of times their security tests were done in a staging environment. So what would end up happening is if there was a security problem if they found a CVE if they uh had a a security token that had been found in the repository, what they would do is this negotiation would take place so a product manager with the director of whatever agency they were working for, they would sort of be like, oh no, no, don't worry about that security issue, we'll fix it in the next sprint. And we all know how that goes. It never makes it into the next sprint. It goes into the backlog and then somewhere down the road in 68, 12 months it'll eventually end up making it, but then we don't look at the surface, uh, coverage that we have for that period of time where we are outside of compliance. So the insurance company that I worked for. Um, the thing that I found very interesting is when it comes to compliance, being able to build a repeatable process will allow you to be able to meet a lot of the needs without having to slow you down, and what we wanna be able to do is we wanna be able to think about how do I get a transparent culture around security first in the hands of the developer. This is not asking the developer to fix every security issue. This is about a culture of being able to have a conversation about security related issues so you can determine, hey, is this actually gonna be an issue in production or is it not? Now if we do know that this is going to be a security problem, we can work with the security engineering team working with the developer to be able to build a remediation plan so we can happen in flight. This could also be something where we document an exception that goes into the. Release so we can then have an API that we can query at the end of a release cycle to be able to say hey you know what we know that there was a security incident we were willing to manage the risk and then being able to know that in another release that we were able to be able to remediate that issue now Casey manages uh one of the highest uh uh regulated environments inside of GovCloud. And they do this by being able to automate a lot of the security related tasks, whether this be edge-based security or this be app sack security from the very beginning. Now In the very beginning when we started working with Casey, the first thing that we wanted to be able to do is we wanted to be able to bring in security that wasn't creating bottlenecks for everything else along the process. Everybody today with artificial intelligence, we want to move really fast. We're gonna vibe code all of our changes. Well, that works great for a developer, but it doesn't work for the rest of the team. So we worked with them, we started talking about what we call a Gitlab AI enhanced teams, the whole concept of a rising tide lifts all boats. Well, I need my product manager to be have productivity. I need my release manager. I need my security team. All of those people, if I'm able to start to automate a lot of those things for them, I can use AI to enhance that automation to be able to make things a lot easier. Now the turning point for Casey what they wanted is they when they started looking at all their different security tools they started looking at how they managed uh their sprint planning everything else they had about 18 different tools that they were trying to manage. Well, having 18 different tools and having integration points between each one, it actually slowed them down. It was great because each person in the persona of whatever tool they were using they were able to use those tools at a very high efficiency but then when they needed to do a hand off between tools there was a lot of uh um a gap in transparency around why a particular change was happening. So what they did is they brought in Gitlab to be able to provide them with a single end to end platform where all of the data around issues to merge requests to change sets to security to package management all those things all sat inside of one single platform what they were able to do is that allowed them to create automation that was all data driven. So they had they knew about the issues they knew about the change sets they knew about releases they could then react and have actionable insights around that data. Now Because they were able to use Gitlab on AWS Cloud, what that did is that allowed them to facilitate a much faster um um ATO to being able to run, uh things like red data, being able to run mission critical top secret applications because the data was going into an already um a proven infrastructure. Around the automation around the data around everything else because it was running inside of GovCloud if they would have tried to run that in their own data center or if they tried to run that just in a regular public cloud, they would have had to go through an entire process for ATO that would have slowed their entire delivery system down. And then every time they needed to build a new set of automations, those automations would each had to have been approved as well, so being able to build a set of reusable assets that are all running on top of already proven hardened infrastructure allowed them to be able to move very fast. Now One of the things I we put this in here for the slides I am not a fan of talking about shifting left security part of the reason why is it sort of changes the mentality of who owns the actual security change. So I am a fan of creating a conversation around security around the data that we should all be sharing and everybody should be on the same page. I've seen a lot of organizations where they're running. Specific tooling and what they do is they uh a security engineer goes ahead from their CI pipeline they get uh an email that shows oh by the way, the CI run just happened and by the way there are 10 criticals. Well, how does that help the developer? By being able to have the ability by being able to share those critical issues as part of a feedback loop to the developers while they're in the code and they're making those changes, we're able to improve the velocity so it's not changing the ownership of the security but providing the visibility for security related um activities. Now being able to standardize um around automated processes what they did is it wasn't one of those things that they had to worry about doing it for a single project they built reusable assets so inside of Gitlab we have uh your regular Gitlab CI file which is your pipeline for how you define the chain define the automation. But then you have templates and components and then what you can do is you can work with different teams for compliance to be able to go ahead and say OK we've certified this component if you use it then we can get you past this part of the audit process so then as a development team they can create a new issue uh a new um project template that automatically. Includes all of those components and all those templates so when they go out the door they know that their pipeline is already certified it's already auditable they know that they're within compliance now the great thing about this is is we have this capability inside of Gitlab around compliance pipelines that we can go ahead and you can automatically just check boxes and what will happen is is. Based on your current environment when we run and get the data back from your SAT scanner, from your software composition analysis, whatever licenses are being used, we can automatically flag those items and make sure that a developer can't merge changes into a uh different branch, keeping you from making sure that bad code never makes it into a production environment. So all of those things are now happening automatically and then what we're able to do inside of Gitlab is being able to use things like streaming events so any time we do authentication authorization somebody changes adds a new role to their Gitlab projects they add somebody manually to a project they change somebody's permission and give them greater authorization to do work those streaming audits can. Now go to your SIEM tool and you can then have something like pager duty automatically notify a security engineer, hey, Lee just did something really bad and gave Susan moderator rights and Susan does not have the right clearance to be able to have access to this project at that level. So these are the kinds of things that they were able to completely automate away by being able to use Gitlab use those through those standardized processes. The other thing that we do inside of Gitlab is when you think about how you organize projects, so there's groups, subgroups, and projects so you create this file system type taxonomy that the security and authorization flows down to the lower level leaf nodes. So now if I'm inside. Of a subgroup and all of my projects are grouped inside of there I can secure the subgroup without having to go to every individual project I add a new project into there all those permissions are automatically granted to that new project that allows us to create a culture of collaboration and transparency. So now if you're building a microservices type architecture for an application that you're writing, I can make sure that everybody knows what's going on across all those projects now if I'm running a security scan, I will aggregate all of those security scans to the subgroup so I can see all of the criticals across every project that is inside of that taxonomy. Now when I went back and talked to the CTO and one of the items that was really critical to them was not just about providing specific capabilities to the teams but because they're a systems integrator one of the items that they have is they had deliverables that they had to meet inside of the government now anybody here who's ever done. Any sort of government contract type work, it's one of the things that always seems like it's over budget it's always behind and what they did is they were one of the few SIs that do fixed price projects so because it's fixed price they had to deliver on time on budget, otherwise it started eating away at their top line revenue. So being able to automate a lot of these different processes allowed their development teams to get up to speed and on board very quickly knowing that they were taking a security first approach. So what this was able to do is they were able to have a 90% savings in uh labor and administrative overhead because a lot of things were pattern based. They also had 13 times faster security scanning because they were doing it off of a diff, so they were doing it on a smaller chain set when you use others. Security tools and you're doing it over the entire code base, it takes a lot longer to run. You can imagine you have 10 million lines of code trying to re-scan the same code over and over again. It takes a long time. That also means that I'm eating up compute cycles inside my AWS environment, so I'm burning through my commitsin. So being able to do this where you're doing it on a much smaller subset, we're able to get that feedback loop back to the engineering teams a lot faster. And then being able to consolidate those 7+ tools down into a single platform gave them that ability to be able to see things from end to end in a lot better way. So lessons from any other any other company that works inside of a regulated industry, the key takeaways that we see from this particular example are compliance does not mean you have to compromise. What you wanna be able to do is you wanna be able to come forward with an automation first mentality and then bake in those things that you want as best practices inside of that automation. You wanna remove integrations. The more integrations you can remove, I usually have a slide that um uh usually does not get approved by the AWS uh uh people where I show a big dumpster fire when we start talking about integrations. Integrations usually happen through what's called a web hook, and web hooks are non-guaranteed delivery. So if you're expecting there to be a tool to run your security scan and you're expecting to trigger that from a web hook if that particular security product is down, you're gonna go ahead and execute off of a web hook that's gonna fire and forget. So now you're gonna go build a package that may never have ever had a security scan run against it. So being able to have everything inside that single platform, we have that guaranteed delivery across Gitlab. And then being able to leverage Gitlab plus AWS GovCloud gives us that secure, scalable, fast infrastructure that we all know and depend on from that security first mindset. So when you think about systems integrators, you think about projects that are running there, just know that agility is possible we can move fast, we can do fixed price projects, and we know that we can deliver on time, on budget with a security first mindset. So with that I wanna thank you all for coming out to the session and if there are any questions I'll be over at the booth be more than happy to talk to any of you after the session's over. Thank you very much.
