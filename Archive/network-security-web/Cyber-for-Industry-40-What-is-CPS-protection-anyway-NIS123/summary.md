## Summary
This session introduces **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) protection** to cloud security professionals, highlighting the emerging convergence between the physical and digital worlds in Industry 4.0. Presenters from AWS and Clarity explain how CPS—including IoT, OT, medical devices (IOMT), and smart building infrastructure—represents a unique and growing attack surface.

Unlike traditional IT, CPS environments involve older, often unpatched or air-gapped devices with unique performance and availability constraints. The session explores how legacy protection strategies (like air gaps) are breaking down due to trends like remote maintenance and AI-powered analytics, and how AWS services (like Greengrass, IoT Core, GuardDuty) can help bridge secure cloud-to-OT integration.

## Key Points
- **What is CPS?**  
  A unifying term (per Gartner) that includes:
  - **IoT**: Designed for connectivity, often lacks built-in security.
  - **OT (Operational Technology)**: Legacy industrial systems (e.g., PLCs, HMIs) designed to be air-gapped.
  - **Medical Devices (IOMT)**: Infusion pumps, MRI machines, etc., treated like OT in healthcare.
  - **Smart Building Systems**: HVAC, elevators, fire suppression, access control—all digitized.

- **Why CPS Protection Matters Now**  
  - Growing attacks targeting physical systems (e.g., sabotage of Moscow sewage alarms).
  - Gartner’s first Magic Quadrant for CPS protection released in Feb 2025.
  - Remote access and AI/ML use cases are eroding traditional air-gap defenses.
  - Increased convergence of IT and OT networks expands attack surface.

- **Challenges in CPS Security**  
  - **Cultural divide** between IT and OT teams.
  - **Obscure proprietary hardware** with limited security capabilities.
  - **Resource-constrained devices** often can’t support encryption or agent-based security.
  - **Complex vendor ecosystems** with device-specific protocols and no standardized patching.
  - **High availability requirements** make downtime unacceptable.

- **Security Approach & Best Practices**  
  - **Asset Visibility**: Identify all devices in CPS environments (e.g., using Clarity).
  - **Exposure Management**: Find and fix misconfigurations, default credentials, vulnerable services.
  - **Network Segmentation**: Minimize blast radius of any breach.
  - **Threat Detection**: Use behavioral analysis to detect anomalies.
  - **Secure Remote Access**: Must be zero trust, role-based, auditable, and time-bound.
  - **Shrink the Attack Surface**: Eliminate unnecessary services and open ports.

- **Cloud Integration for CPS**  
  - **AWS Greengrass**: Run compute/storage offline at the edge.
  - **AWS IoT Core**: Securely connect devices to the cloud.
  - **AWS GuardDuty & Security Hub**: Detect and manage threats across hybrid CPS/IT environments.
  - **Offline-first architectures** are achievable using AWS services tailored for edge computing.

- **Security by Design for OT+Cloud**  
  - Security concerns are still a major blocker for OT-to-cloud projects.
  - Embedding security from day one increases project success and reduces POC-to-production friction.

## Technical Details
- **Real-World Architecture:**
  - OT systems at the edge → AWS Greengrass for local control
  - Secure feed into AWS cloud → processing, alerting, and integration with supply chain systems
  - Security services (GuardDuty, Security Hub) used for centralized observability

- **Resilient Response Plan:**
  - Red/blue/purple team exercises
  - Simulate breach response not just until it's right—but until you *can’t get it wrong*
  - Focus on *cyber resilience*, not just protection

- **Framework Parallels with IT Security:**
  - Many CPS security principles map to familiar IT strategies—just adapted for physical infrastructure

All right, good evening everyone and welcome. Uh, in this session, we'll be going over cyber for Industry 4.0. Uh, what is CPS production anyway? So without further ado, uh, let's introduce, uh, Sean Gilson. Go ahead. All right. Hi everyone. My name is Sean Ear, global head of Cloud Alliances for clarity. Yes, and he, hey everybody, my name is Gilson Wilson, and I lead the security competency at AWS for all of our GSI and ISA partners and I also lead uh initiatives like our secure and resilient migrations program here at AWS. So Sean, awesome. So we're at the world's premier cloud security conference. This conversation is a talk about CPS protection, a primer level introduction to CPS protection for cloud security professionals like yourselves. So this is a term that has been increasingly has been increasing in importance lately. Let's start by defining it. So Gartner has brought this term to the forefront to provide a unified approach to thinking about 4 different categories of technology that have been around for a while and have required security for a while, but under this new term cyber physical systems. In a nutshell, CPS is where the digital world and the physical world come together, so. The first, the first category of technology included under CPS are IOT devices. This is this is equipment and devices that were designed for connectivity. They've been around for about 10, maybe 15 years, designed for connectivity but not necessarily designed with security in mind. Second category operational technology or OT, so there's IT and then there's OT, information technology and operational technology. Here we're talking about devices and equipment and assets that are older than IoT, things that were designed to be. You deployed in air gapped environments like manufacturing facilities, critical infrastructure, oil and gas we're talking about HMI's and PLCs controlling large pieces of industrial equipment like conveyor belts and uh and smelters. Third category medical devices, sometimes referred to as IOMT Internet of medical things. Medical devices like infusion pumps and MRI machines and nurses workstations aren't typically referred to as OT in the healthcare industry, but the approach to securing them is similar. And then the fourth category, a little bit newer, building management systems. When you think about modern construction and you think about efficient buildings with connected uh HVAC and fire suppression and intelligent lighting. Uh, access control and security cameras, all the smart technology inside of modern buildings, elevators. If you elevators used to just have a dumb up button and a down button. Now you go over, you hit a touch screen, you indicate which floor you want to go to. All of that equipment controlled digitally now, and everything that can be controlled digitally can be attacked digitally. When we're talking about CPS protection and CPS risk, the risks are different. We're not just talking about risks to data anymore. We're not talking about hacking an email server, exfiltrating PHI or uh publishing credit card numbers on the dark web. We're talking about um taking over an HMI human machine interface and literally affecting the controls on a machine that changes things in the physical world so over here we talk about um a hacker, an adversary. Causing equipment to exceed its normal operating parameters, taking over the security controls and disabling them, changing the set points. The set point on a machine is how fast, how high, how hot, how much pressure, right, cranking it up to 11, and then shutting down shutting down access so the admins can't get in and fix it. Many, many examples of adversaries coming after physical systems and wreaking havoc in the physical world. Um, one of them we might pick out the Ukrainian attack, Ukrainian affiliated hackers attacked the sewage systems in Moscow and without firing a shot or setting off a bomb, they destroyed 87,000 smart alarms underneath the city, disabling the sewage system. That type of attack is sabotage. It's not just espionage anymore, and there are many, many such examples. So, uh, in February, Gartner issued their very first magic quadrant for this space, reflects the growth in the problem and also the maturity of the vendors that have come out with solutions to address the problem. They profiled 17 vendors, 5 appeared in the top right quadrant, and we're very proud to say that clarity was rated highest for ability to execute and furthest to the right for completeness of vision. Um, as much as we are proud of that placement, it's the feedback from our customers, um, public feedback, and also, uh, anonymous feedback collected by analysts that we're very, very proud of. So why is this happening now? Why are we seeing this sudden growth in uh in cyber attacks on physical equipment and why did Gartner recognize the growth in this market now? Well, there's, we're we're living at the intersection of two historic trends. Ah, sorry, before getting into that, let me take a step back and describe some of the important differences between IT environments and CPS environments. First of all, inside of a company, the people responsible for IT and the people responsible for say the factory, the automation systems, the critical infrastructure, it's different teams, different teams with different cultures, priorities and protocols for how they work. Secondly, the equipment you will find on these different networks in these environments radically different. In a data center, uh, for an IT organization, it doesn't matter whether you're a healthcare org, a manufacturing org, um, a, a critical infrastructure, your data center kind of looks the same. You're all buying the same servers and you're all buying the same laptops, but in the line of business. It's wildly, it's wildly different, right? There are so many vendors with so many different pieces of equipment. The infusion pump you find in a hospital will never appear in uh in uh uh auto uh automobile. Uh, factory, the conveyor belt in that factory won't appear in an oil field. The centrifuge, uh, that you find in a drug manufacturing facility won't appear in either of those, right? So tremendous range in the equipment that needs to be protected, um, and most of this equipment there, the, uh, the amount of, uh, we talk about the shortage of security practitioners in the IT side. It's far worse in the OT side. We're talking about obscure equipment that very few people know how to deal with, so when something goes wrong, you're often required to call in the vendor, the OEM manufacturer of that equipment to troubleshoot it, um. On the IT side, cybersecurity is a very mature industry. In addition to all the vendors we have here, there are thousands of cybersecurity vendors offering solutions and tools to help companies secure IT. The OT side. This is the tools are far fewer and far less mature. Clarity, the market leader in the space, we just celebrated our 10 year anniversary, um. What this means is that for the longest time, CPS Security relied on the air gap. That was the predominant strategy for securing the line of business. That's changing now for two main reasons. The first is we had COVID a few years ago, right? COVID meant that people couldn't get on planes and travel. And so if uh equipment if equipment in a facility required expert attention, your technician, your maintenance uh provider couldn't physically get on a plane and come and plug in their laptop and address the issue. And so customers opened up. Remote access in an insecure way, basically punching a hole through their firewall through the air gap, um, which obviously increased the surface area. The second, uh, major trend is the term I'll only use it once here today. AI and ML, right? Everyone wants more connectivity to the shop floor. Everyone wants to implement industrial data fabrics. Everyone wants to use predictive maintenance on IoT data or drive worker safety and quality control in the facility in real time using machine vision. All of these transformational projects require eliminating the air gap and connecting the shop floor to the cloud. Both of these two trends increase the surface area for intact. Um, it's also the reason that Clarity and AWS have such a deep strategic partnership. Um, I'm about to wrap and we've said so much about how CPS protection and CPS assets are so different from IT assets. They actually have some things in common. You as security practitioners already have a particular framework of thinking about security that you can apply to thinking about CPS protection. It all starts with asset visibility just like in the cloud, just like deploying a CSP right? um, you have to, you can't protect what you can't see, you have to start by identifying all of the assets that you have in your environment. And deciding how important they are, what their value is, and what the disruption could be. From there you move on to exposure management, understanding what's connected to the internet that shouldn't be, what has a default password from the manufacturer that shouldn't, um, what has a known exploited vulnerability that needs to be addressed. From there you move to network protection, implementing segmentation in order to contain any potential breach. And finally proactive threat detection, looking at patterns of behavior identifying anomalous behavior and then investigating potential threats. In addition to that standard flow, remember we're dealing with physical assets in a physical part of the world. It's not just the cloud, and so you have to open up remote access in a secure way, which is enterprise grade. Zero trust based, loggable, permission-based, and time-bound. And uh those are the basic building blocks of CPS security. Wilson, thank you. Thanks Sean and uh you know like like Sean mentioned, it's probably, you know, interesting to see when we have uh CPS essentially cyber physical systems and operational technology that's in a cloud security conference here today because we're all about the cloud, but it would surprise you sometimes to know that there's a lot of services and technologies that AWS does offer which makes the connection. So one of the things that I wanted to start off with was in terms of breaches by industry that we see today and all of last year if you look at most of it, yes you know you see the usual you know financial services and insurance companies, etc. however, if you look at the bottom. Quadrant other than financial services, almost all of them have one thing in common, which is industrial systems, operational technology, signal processing and things of that nature, uh, on the. Uh, on the, on the public sector education and healthcare, I would say a lot of state and local government and federal organizations as well fall in that category in terms of a significant amount of uh hacking attempts and vulnerabilities that have hit for critical infrastructure as well and so that has peaked over time. And like Sean had mentioned earlier, the, you know, outside of CPS security still is considered as the number one detriment for anybody or at least hesitation in moving workloads into the cloud, and CPS is no different as well, especially when it comes to things like uh when you wanna move projects from POC to production, you get into a sense of. Where security falls in to actually uh slow down the adoption of cloud uh and and this is just based on stats that we have gleaned over time from several customers and by incorporating security right from the get go like security by design you would actually be able to deploy workloads into the cloud much faster and you'd also have higher success rate for your projects as well. Now what are the challenges? Sean touched a little bit about the differences between IT and OT. And but what are the challenges that you see in terms of security? One of the things, and if you've seen my other talks as well, uh, when, when I, when I talk about security in general, you'll see that. A lot of it is still doing the basics in terms of data security in terms of uh network security etc. but when it comes to cyber physical systems, some of the challenges are things like performance and availability right? the. Well, I don't know why this keeps going forward. Um, a lot of, a lot of stuff that we do with, um, CPS systems especially are, are essentially real time. They, they have to have pretty much, you know, 100% up time for the most part in terms of any kinds of outages and things like that, you have the you have flexibility when it comes to IT, but with OT there's usually like weeks of planning. There's also months of planning that actually can can need to be happen for any kind of outages and things like that that have to come in. In terms of Um, resource constraints. This is a big one between IT and OT. A lot of the devices actually don't have enough compute and memory to hold things like encryption libraries and security capabilities and applications. They, um, they, they weren't essentially designed for that. Some of. The newer ones absolutely are, but there's still a lot of industrial systems that don't have that capability. And so from a communication standpoint they're usually mixed from IT and OT as well and I think the only other thing that I would raise over here is, uh, let me come back somebody keeps going forward. Um, the only other thing that I would raise over here is in terms of system operation and operating systems that are kind of known to all of us in the IT space and and how they how they're deployed versus some of the automated tools that we and there are automated tools already that we use in our, you know, for patch management and operating system uh management as well versus proprietary hardware um that that might be there for signals and other devices. So when it comes to securing cyber physical systems, what do we really mean, right? I mentioned earlier, keeping it simple is very important. Doing the basics is still having good discipline. Having good cyber discipline still stands foremost as some of the things that you can do to protect yourself from cyber challenges for IIOT and OT devices in general. So the first one, secure all layers. Defense in depth is still is still being leveraged, establishing zero trust boundaries. Um, securing network connections. So all the usual encryption, I think Edward Snowden said it at one point where he said that encryption is essentially the defense against dark odds for, uh, information technology, and that still stands true to this case for secure protocols. Um, the one thing that I will bring up over here is shrinking the attack surface. Many of these devices do have, um, a significant amount of, you know, uh uh services that are either switched on or capabilities that are switched on in the system, and what you want to do is not only harden but eliminate any of those things that can be a potential threat to the attack surface or in fact increasing your increasing your attack surface and. What's important now is that many organizations have their industrial manufacturing critical infrastructure hooked up to the cloud and other IT services because they need to get that kind of observability. They need to use that for analytics. Maybe they want to hook it up to their supply chain ordering mechanisms and things. Of that nature basically to understand when the system is failing or needs to be replaced, for example, and every time you do that you're increasing the attack surface significantly and so by following the policy of shrinking that as much as possible, doing the analysis, it's very important to keep that in mind. The last thing I want to highlight over here is having a resilient response plan. Now, what does, what does that mean, right? The key thing here is we always We always advise and coach on having a battle plan to to manage your response plan because breaches by themselves are never disasters, it's your response to a breach that will can significantly take your organization in one path or the other, and we continuously uh uh talk about running simulations, red, blue team, purple teaming. Uh, exercises we, we practice on continue to do it not till you get it right, but continue to do it till you can't get it wrong. It's uh it's something that we've copied from uh from different coaching manuals but running attack simulations on how you can recover very quickly cyber resilience is now pretty much the key to success in managing not just IT environments but IT and OT environments as well. So, what does, what does this essentially look like from an architecture perspective? So I'm just gonna go through like an example architecture of what it would look like everything from like an on and this is a real, this is a real example with names removed, obviously, but Starting from on premises manufacturing network with different types of devices, you know, either they have networks or they don't, they have their own secure protocols that they use for communication, etc. and this is essentially what we would consider layer one and one of the things that we mentioned was how does. Uh AWS kind of fit into this. Offline mood of operations since we're actually a cloud first company. If you think about uh services like not many people know this, but there's services like uh that we run on the edge there's AWS IOT, there's AWS Greengrass and all of these services are intended to help you run. Services offline without needing connection to the internet at all, and they have, so you can run compute, you can run storage, you can run all of that offline within your own premises and as and when you require access to the internet to help you secure all of those and collect signals, so you could use something like AWS Greengrass to work with all of your sensors, collect all that signal, collect all of that information, and then feed it up to. Um, the AWS cloud where you can use it for more intelligent processing and supply chain management and maybe repairability and maintainability, etc. and, and as you can see, and at that point you can leverage things like AWS guard duty and AWS security hub to actually pull that information in to to help you further uh further keep all of your your entire infrastructure holistically secure so. Thank you very much for listening. Sean, do you have any final thoughts? Thanks everyone. If you're interested in learning more, clarity is at booth 321. Very easy to find us. If you work for a company in consumer goods, manufacturing, heavy industry, health care, life sciences, and you aren't already working on OT security, chances are it'll eventually enter into your life, because CISOs and IT teams are being told they have to protect the company from threats everywhere, not just IT. Thank you everybody. Thanks, Wilson.
