Cool, hello everyone. uh, thank you so much for coming out this evening. My name is Mata. I am a solutions architect here at AWS and today I am excited to talk a little bit more about the AWS web application firewall and how we're able to shield applications from digital threats. So in today's agenda I wanna talk a little bit more first about customer challenges that are faced especially when hosting applications on AWS. From there we'll talk a bit more about how AWS web application firewall can provide that application level security, showcase how to implement this within the AWS solution architecture. Highlight a demo of ways to set up these rules, um, provide a little bit more about these potential outcomes and next steps from there. So why don't we begin with some of these customer challenges, right? So as we are hosting these web applications, one key challenge that we see is the critical need for real-time monitoring. Especially as these applications are being hosted globally for users to access, sometimes there are attacks or threats that hit our applications. This is where we need to ensure that incident response times are minimized and without some of these real-time capabilities, a lot of organizations often are playing catch up when these attacks occur. Secondly, there is a rise of web attacks that are happening, especially with our customized applications or other common platforms, we notice that these applications can be constantly under attack. So over time we have noticed that these attacks are also becoming increasingly more sophisticated, so this is leading to a lot more data breaches that are occurring and longer downtime for these applications. Thirdly, another customer challenge risk that we're seeing is complex bot traffic detection. So there's two different types of bots. So there's good bots that are gonna be set in place, such as search engines, but there's also bots that are trying to scrape applications to gather a lot of this business critical data. Sometimes it's hard to differentiate these legitimate bots versus malicious bots. So it's hard for a lot of the security teams to detect and prevent a lot of this automated traffic effectively. And lastly, poor traffic visibility. So we've noticed that a lot of security teams struggle to set that baseline of how many requests should be hitting these applications. So a lot of teams. are unable to set this up leading to traffic spikes where they're unable to figure out is this actually a user that wants to view these applications or is it an attacker trying to attack these web pages this also leads to a lot of resource allocation decisions made with incomplete information so how can we address some of these customer challenges? This is where we can leverage one of our services, AWS Web Application Firewall, also known as AWS WAFF. This service specifically provides Level 7 protection in the OSI model and ensures that these applications are safe. So with this service we're able to ensure that we have complete web vulnerability protection so we're able to set up certain rules in place to prevent our applications from SQL injections or cross cross-site scripting issues or even if you have more customized rules that you would want to implement for your specific security posture, you're able to do so. With AWSAF we're also able to identify what are some of these legitimate users versus malicious bots that are in place and how we can prevent, you know, credential stuffing attacks from happening. And lastly with this web application firewall we're able to actually set up real time mon monitoring so with this you're able to see detailed security dashboards in place as well as storing some of these logs of the requests that are hitting your app. Locations and further audit them and query them for compliance purposes. So what makes this service particularly powerful is the way that's able to integrate seamlessly amongst other AWS services and I'll be discussing this in the next slide. So as you can see, this is our AWS solutions architecture diagram. So on the right handmos side we have our Amazon EC2 or Elastic Compute cloud service. This is utilized to host our overall application using a compute instance. As you can see, to provide or access this content for users to view these applications, we can then leverage one of our services known as Amazon Cloud Front. This is a content delivery network service to ensure that users globally are able to access these web applications. So now how can we include that security in place? So between the users trying to hit the request to view these applications, we can ensure that we're able to set up AWSAF between the user level and Amazon Cloud front. With this we're able to create these rules so we're able to ensure that our applications are secure and a lot of these logs that we enable can be stored within one of our storage services called Amazon S3 known as Amazon Simple Storage Service. To get further monitoring benefits, this is where we can actually query some of these logs utilizing Amazon Athena and create more customized dashboards leveraging one of our monitoring services known as Amazon Cloudwatch. So now that I explained to you some of the services in place and ways we can set up WAF, why don't I show you a demo of how to create some of these rules? So as you see over here, this is our AWS console and the first step that we're gonna do is navigate to our service, uh, aAF and shield. So once you select on this, you are able, it'll take you to a page where we are able to navigate to our protection pack. So this is the page that we see, and on the left hand side tab we're gonna be selecting resources and protection. So once we navigate to this, this is where you're able to see your protection packs. Protection packs are used to combine a lot of these rules or rule sets to ensure that you're able to protect your applications from infrastructure level threats. So once we go to this protection pack, you're able to see one that's already generated and there's a resource in place connecting it to our cloud front distribution. Within this you're also able to see a diagram of some of the allowed or blocked requests that are hitting these applications and now I wanna talk through one approach that we can take so let's say we wanna protect our application from more SQL injections to not hit it, right? So this is where when we go to actions and manage rules we can set up some of these rules in place. So what we're gonna do now is once we are. Navigating to this managed rule we'll click on add a rule and navigate specifically to the AWS managed rule group. So within this AWS already has some rules in place that can provide that level of security. So we have a combination of free as well as paid rules and going back to that use case we're gonna select SQL database and we're gonna select all of the requests that are related to SQL database and we can add that rule. But what if you want to create more customized rules? So let's say we want to block our overall application from. A URI path that says hash includes, right? How are we able to set this up? This is where we can create more customized rules. So we're gonna select add rule, and when we go here we're able to select custom rule. So with this custom rule there's a few different types of rules. So if you wanna block certain IP addresses you're able to do so. If you want to block a certain. Countries from accessing an application using geo-based rules you you're able to do that as well as rate-based rules but for now we're gonna select custom rules. So when we select custom rules, the first step that we'll need to do is name the rule that we would want in place. So the rule name that we're gonna include is path block, and we want to block a certain request from happening if it hits hash include. Right, so we're gonna stay over here if it matches a particular string and we're gonna type in hash includes we're gonna ensure that's able to block it and we have generated both an AWS managed rule as well as a customized rule so now that we have this in place you're able to see that we have our protections configured and we can. Enable logging as well so this is where we're able to get a lot of our audit trends in place where we can do further monitoring to this data. So one approach that we can take to monitor this is taking that data that's stored in S3 and doing some queries to it. So I'm gonna be navigating to Amazon Athena, which is one of our SQL based querying services. As you can see it's already leveraging our logs stored in one of our day tables and with this we're gonna, I'm going to generate a query which will keep track to see how many requests are being blocked for our AWS managed rule. So as you can see, these are all of the results that we have and is able to highlight which rules in place and the client IP associated with it. What if I want to also create a more customized dashboard? This is where we can go to Amazon Cloud Watch and go to all metrics. We'll then select Wauu, which is specific to our web application firewall, and select all of the rules. So from there we're able to generate to see, OK, what's hitting your application? Are these allowed or are these blocked? So with this you're able to create something more customized and you can. Toggle along based on the metrics that you would want to see. So with this, I hope you're able to understand firstly how we're able to protect against these web threats. We can create managed rules as well as customized rules as seen in this demo. In addition to that too, we're able to gain visibility over malicious bot attacks that are hitting these applications, so especially with web application firewall, we're able to ensure that we can identify legitimate bots over malicious bots and we can set real-time security monitoring and analysis. So within our web ACL we are able to keep track of our overall data and also. Query these logs for Amazon Athena and create customized dashboards with Amazon Cloudwatch, and with this we're able to ensure that our overall security posture experiences minimal false positives. So with this, I hope this gives you a pretty good idea. If you would like to learn a little bit more about this service, this is a really great workshop I highly recommend you take a look at. This will provide a lot more hands on guidance along with our getting started with AWSAF. This is a really great user documentation which will provide you a lot more context in terms of how to set up this service. Thank you all so much for coming to this Lightning Talk today.
