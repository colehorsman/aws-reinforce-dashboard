## Full Transcript

So good afternoon. Uh, my name is Steve Clark. I'm the director of Cloud Alliances for ARIS. We're gonna talk about redefining cybersecurity for modern threats with, uh, Armorcentric. Before we get into the product piece, I just want to talk about what we do in marketplace. So hopefully you're leveraging marketplace. It's a very fast way to roll out product, uh, procure product. Um, secondly, it helps you leverage your, your commit if you're happy having an EDP, uh, you can burn down those commits. Super easy to buy. Um, we have global access for the, the product suite, um, so it's really easy to whatever region you might be in, um, for those who are in Gov, we're in GovCloud as well. And then, uh, no disruption. So what I mean by that, we would give you the capability of tying in uh the other vendor solutions. I'll go through that. So why, why, why look at armor? Really, it's the challenge. So today, 40% of connected assets remain unmonitored. Right, you think about there's a particular customer I know who ran their scan with using our tools, ran it against their service now and realized a third of their assets weren't covered. Um, I was just in New York with a financial services company and about 6 months ago they had a knock on a door from a 3 letter acronym saying you guys need to take a look at your critical infrastructure, your elevators, your lighting, your HVAC. The average team is facing a backlog of 121,000 findings in the industry we call this threat fatigue, right? So how do I deal with all these threats? How do I take all these threats, figure out which are the highs and mediums and lows, and then hand them off to my analysis team to take care of these. This is the killer. 197 days before you know there's something in your network, and then to top it off, it takes 70 days to contain it. So as you talk to various vendors, we all talk about time to remediation. This is the critical thing, right? Something's in my network. I need to find it, then I need to triage it and I need to keep the business up and running. So we really got to get this 69 days down to something a lot more palatable. 2 weeks, 3 weeks. So what we talk about at Armas is the, the question is what do I have? What's out there? What are all my assets? Where do they reside? Where are my IT IoT, my medical devices, right? What am I doing in the cloud? What's important? What I mean by what is important is what's a high threat? What's a medium threat, what's a low threat? And by the way, a medium threat might be more impactful to the business because it's affecting 10,000 devices. A high might just be affecting 1. So how do I figure out what's important in my environment? And then lastly, how do I fix it? Right? So if you've been around in security as long as I have, we all talk about, hey, I'll give you all these alerts, but how do you fix those alerts? How do I deal with that? How do I make sure that my teams are uh able to keep the business up and running? So, when we talk about what do I have, right? These are all the critical assets are sitting in my environment. Figure out what's sitting out there, right, assess all that information. Number 2, what's important? So we just talked about how do I figure out um the scans coming from Qualis. Earlier up here was Tenable Trellex, right? How do I take that information? We partner with Wiz, we partner with Qualis. We partner with CrowdStrike, we take direct feeds from from guard duty from EWS. We take all of this data and we help you figure out what is really critical to my business, what's the risk to my business. And then how do I fix it, right? So how do I take this information and assign it to the right people in the organization? If I'm looking at, you know, a scanning tool, that might be only be providing 25% of what I really need, right? So how do I leverage the other tools in my environment and be able to address what's happening? So what we have is what we call arm centric centrics. So a cyber exposure management platform. So we look at account management and security, right? Complete assessment of all your asset types. OT IoT security, right? What do I have in that space? How do I see and secure all those IOT networks? My physical assets, medical devices, right? So I'm going in to get a CAT scan. I'm going in for open heart surgery, right? I want to make sure those devices are protected. So we have the functionality that allows us to make the semen's information secure, the information from General Electric, right, all your medical devices. Um, Viper Pro is where we really consolidate and prioritize all of those threat vectors and all that information and the findings. And then more recently, early warning, right? This is kind of like my analogy for the heart attack, wouldn't it be nice if I went to the doctor and figured out, hey, you have to take better care of yourself. So early warning allows me to figure out how to take better care of my network. And we do all this in a nice graphical form, right? So I can see on here, you know, what are my total assets. I get the visibility of everything that's happening in my network at at real time. So here's what the platform looks like. Um, I'm not gonna read everything. I'm gonna kinda pick some of the highlights. I mentioned some of the integration partners, right? And if there is someone that's not on here, um, we can definitely work with them via, via an API. The telemetry we provide, right, that's that whole visibility about what's happening in my network. Um, the early warning aspect, right? So we're, you know, we're at an AUS conference, got to use the term AI, right? So AI and machine learning to help us figure out what's happening in my environment. Um, we can feed, as I mentioned earlier, into like, uh, ServiceNow. We work closely with Fortiet or Splunk so I can take all this data. It gets really loud when I walk over here, by the way, uh, take all this data and then feed it up. Uh, network enforcement, right? We've got Cisco, we've got Aruba, we've got, uh, Palo Alto, and then of course ticket workflow. So just imagine I've got Jill and Bill. I can go in and create a workflow as I find these threats, and Jill will solve that issue. And then Bill has his own set. So I'm taking this all the way down to the individual folks in my team who have to do the remediation. So asset management security, so full asset inventory, right? So once again, even cloud and even your virtual machines, right? So don't just think IT and, and IoT and Complete asset security process management. So we do a complete gap analysis on your environment and figure out where you are from that hygiene standpoint, right? Once again, am I healthy? Uh, internal next door compliance reporting. Um, I was at a meeting yesterday and, and there's more compliance issues coming out every single day, right? So we take a lot of that functionality off the plate for you, tying that in. Network segmentation and enforcement, um, I've been around long enough to remember NSX, right? This is 20 years we've been working on network segmentation. The longer we do network segmentation, the more complex it is, and how do I see all my assets. So once again, this is where we help with that. Um, this graphical display shows me, you know, how many VMs do I have, how many mobile phones do I have? We can take this out as far as doing the lighting in your parking lot, right? So there's a lot of information that we can gather from these various devices. So the IT OT aspect, so once again, we detect all the vulnerabilities in your OT environment. Additionally, bridge that IT gap with the OT folks. So the bank that I was talking about in New York, they have a separate team for IT and OT, but they feed into the same IT infrastructure, right? So we have some other tools that allow us to also get you that digital asset information that's not part of your IT and your OT environments. Medical device we talked about this obviously um the capability of looking for the visibility within these environments. The one that was interesting for me is I used a three letter acronym is, you know what happens if there's an FDA issue I have to work on. So managing what's happening in those environments, protecting patient safety. I mean, the last thing I want to do is be going in for surgery and. Some Wi Fi system breaks in. I no longer have my surgery scheduled, right? We have a great case study that talks about Wi Fi being broken that affects what's happening in the airports. So you have to think about this is more than just my lighting system and my HVAC, right? How does it affect my business? So Viper Pro is really our priorititation and remediation solution. So the capability of, you know, automating consolidate the security findings. Um, we were talking to a large OT organization yesterday and he said he was seeing about 30,000 scans. We showed them how we can take that 30,000 scans and drop it down to like 2 or 3000. So we really allow the users to get better granularity. Prioritize response. So as I mentioned earlier, if 1000 devices are affected and it's a medium alert and only 1 is affected but it's a high, we'll help you figure out, I probably should address the 1001st, right? Um, I was using an example like Fidelity. Think of fidelity. Where they have two business units. They have my 401k and they manage $6 billion for like the California State Teachers fun. By the way, my, my 401k is not $6 billion but think about that's how they have to prioritize their business, right? They care more about those entities, right? Um, and then established ownership, right? So we leverage AI to figure out who's actually gonna manage this, who's gonna take advantage of, um, stopping these threats and who's gonna go out and use the skills dashboard to remediate those. So early warning, right, so we use a lot of information out there to figure out what's happening out there from a vulnerability standpoint, prioritizing of real-time exploit data. I'll get into this on the next slide or two, but we have billions of devices that we are monitoring out there. So not just your devices, but potentially similar industries. Um, and then of course get in front of these, right? We want to get in front of these threat actors so we don't just use monitoring of our solutions, we're looking at what's happening in the dark web, right? We're taking a look at it using our own internal assets that we have, um, and really helping you prioritize how do I go out and make sure I have the right security hygiene. So in summary, think about the three aspects of it. We really look at protection, so I want to be able to look about your entire environment and reduce risk. I want to go in and prioritize what you have. So in essence, I want to save you time and then I also want to get that MTTR down. I want to get it down from 69 days. Before we close that, I have a couple more quick slides that are about arm ourselves and then some of our customers. So we have 35+ Fortune 100 customers. Um, we are growing at a very critical rate, 60% year. I'm making sure I'm not gonna blow my ear off again. This is the one that I mentioned earlier, so it's actually 6 billion, 6 billion devices that we're tracking out there today. Um, and then when you think about the, the technology, we've we've been around for a while, but this is also really critical, right? We've got some great backers from an investment standpoint. So when you think of startups, I would not say we're a startup. We are, we are a privately held company, but we've got a good foundation. Now for the big art chart. Um, so when you think about it, I hate the term we can help you sleep better at night, but guess what? Mattress Firm is a customer, so we can help you sleep better at night, right? The ones that are on here that are pretty interesting to me, um, I mentioned Tampa International Airport. That's an actual case study, um, of ours, uh, Mainline Health, um, another case study they actually run inside of AWS as well. And then the one I want to talk about is it's in the transportation category. Um, it's not the one that was breached, not the one that had the crouch I should say. So it's the other one that's up there, a public case study. They were being asked to identify all their assets, right? So they realized they had thousands of assets. They were also being asked to do this because of regulations. So they, they brought in our solution. They were able to figure out where they were versus um their assets they showed in the Service now piece versus what we were able to discover for them. They were able to classify those assets and they did all of this ahead of um the requirements coming out from the Department of Transportation. I'm not gonna quote him exactly, but he basically said that one of the best parts about Armi was it wasn't we were just a one trick solution, we provided integration with some of the other solutions they were offering, some of the other tools that they had in place. I have a really smart guy here, Brian with me because I'm just a sales guy. Brian's the engineer, um, so I want to thank you for your time. I try to keep it at 15 minutes, give you guys back 5 minutes. Happy to answer any questions, and we are literally 2 booths over right there in the middle if you guys want to come by and see a live demo of anything that we're doing.
