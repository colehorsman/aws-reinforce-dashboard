      "author": "",
      "summary": "This session provides a deep dive into the evolving landscape of auditing and compliance for generative AI applications on AWS. The speakers explain that generative AI presents unique challenges compared to traditional predictive AI, as its outputs are contextual and less predictable, making compliance evidence difficult to gather. To address this, AWS has introduced a new framework within **AWS Audit Manager**, developed in partnership with Deloitte. This framework provides a clear, actionable map with 110 controls across eight domains to help customers build responsible and compliant AI solutions. The session uses a sample chatbot application, \"Amazon Ask,\" to walk through these domains and demonstrate how to apply best practices. The core of the talk is a breakdown of the eight domains of responsible AI: Accuracy, Fairness, Privacy, Resilience, Security, Transparency, Explainability, and Governance. For each domain, the speakers define the concept, explain its importance, and provide examples of how to implement controls using AWS services. For instance, they demonstrate how to use the **Model Evaluation** feature in Amazon Bedrock to measure and improve accuracy, and they introduce the concept of a **Bias Assessment** to ensure fairness. The key takeaway is that while the regulatory landscape for generative AI is still uncertain, AWS is providing customers with the tools and best practices they need to start building compliant and responsible AI applications today.",

      "domain": "AI",
      "year": 2024,
      "author": " AWS Events",
      "summary": "In this wide-ranging partner session, consultants from **PwC** discuss four interconnected themes in modern cybersecurity: continuous compliance, cyber resilience, the role of generative AI, and cost optimization. The talk outlines PwC's approach to helping clients address these challenges by building tailored solutions that run entirely within the customer's AWS environment, emphasizing a risk-averse model where PwC does not handle customer data directly. 1.  **Continuous Compliance**: PwC addresses the challenge of meeting multiple, overlapping regulatory requirements (e.g., NIST, PCI, FedRAMP) by building automated compliance dashboards. These solutions ingest security logs from various sources into **AWS Security Lake**, use AWS analytics services to process the data, and create visualizations (e.g., in **QuickSight**) that provide a live, continuous view of the organization's compliance posture. This allows clients to move from manual, periodic audits to a state of constant readiness. 2.  **Cyber Resilience & Automated Recovery**: The session highlights that recovery is an orchestration problem, both within a single application and across a portfolio of interdependent applications. PwC has developed a **Cyber Recovery Engine** powered by **AWS Step Functions** that automates the recovery process for both disaster recovery (DR) and cyber incident scenarios. By automating recovery, organizations can test their plans more frequently, instill confidence in their teams, and drastically reduce their Recovery Time Objective (RTO) from days to minutes. 3.  **Generative AI for Cybersecurity**: PwC is leveraging generative AI, particularly through **Amazon Bedrock** and **Amazon Q in QuickSight**, to make security data more accessible and actionable. By integrating natural language queries into their compliance dashboards, they enable business leaders and non-security personnel to interact with complex security metrics, ask questions, and gain insights without needing deep technical expertise. 4.  **Continuous Resiliency & Cost Optimization**: The talk concludes by tying these concepts together under the theme of \"continuous resiliency.\" Instead of viewing recovery as a periodic exercise, organizations should implement continuous verification checks to ensure that their recovery environments are always in sync and ready. This proactive approach prevents failed recovery attempts caused by configuration drift and ultimately saves time and money. Automation is presented as the key enabler for achieving this in a cost-effective manner.",

      "summary": "This lightning talk demonstrates a practical use case for generative AI: accelerating and enriching AWS Well-Architected Framework Reviews by analyzing architectural diagrams and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates. The speaker shows how **Amazon Bedrock**, using Anthropic's Claude model, can be prompted to act as a security expert, identifying potential misalignments with the best practices outlined in the Well-Architected Framework's Security Pillar. This approach provides a powerful starting point for security reviews, helping teams quickly focus on areas that require deeper discussion and investigation. The session presents two scenarios. In the first, a standard three-tier web application diagram is uploaded to the Bedrock chat playground. With a carefully crafted prompt asking it to evaluate the architecture against the Security Pillar, the model successfully identifies both the best practices that are being followed (e.g., use of multiple VPCs, data redundancy with RDS) and areas needing improvement. In the second, more powerful scenario, the speaker provides the model with the application's **CloudFormation template (in JSON format)** instead of a visual diagram. Because the IaC template contains far more detail than a high-level diagram, the model is able to provide a much more comprehensive and accurate analysis. It identifies additional security best practices that were not visible in the diagram (like the use of AWS Secrets Manager) and uncovers more specific and nuanced risks (like an Application Load Balancer listening on HTTP instead of HTTPS).

      "summary": "This session provides a practical and effective strategy for securing generative AI applications by applying a Zero Trust security model to mitigate the risks outlined in the **OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Through a role-playing scenario involving a healthcare chatbot, the presenters demonstrate why relying solely on prompt engineering for security is insufficient and how a layered, defense-in-depth approach is essential. The core argument of the talk is that the LLM itself should be treated as an **untrusted entity**. The presenters show how a simple prompt injection attack can easily bypass security instructions embedded in a system prompt, leading to critical data leakage (LLM01, LLM06). The naive approach fails because it gives the LLM excessive agency (LLM08) to make authorization decisions based on user-provided (and potentially malicious) input. The successful mitigation strategy involves applying traditional Zero Trust principles *behind* the LLM. Instead of allowing the LLM to decide what data a user can see, the application should propagate the user's authenticated identity immutably through the system to the data access layer. Here, a service like **Amazon Verified Permissions** is used to perform a rigorous, policy-based authorization check *before* any sensitive data is retrieved and sent back to the LLM. This ensures that the LLM only ever receives data that the user is already authorized to see, effectively neutralizing the threat of prompt injection attacks aimed at data exfiltration. The session concludes that while AI-specific defenses like Guardrails and prompt engineering are useful layers, the foundation of a secure GenAI application rests on robust, traditional security controls like identity propagation and centralized authorization.",

The core challenge addressed is how to ensure that different users of a single RAG application can only access information from the specific enterprise documents they are authorized to see. The solution centers on using the metadata filtering capabilities of **Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock**. The presentation explains that a standard RAG workflow involves ingesting various documents into a single vector database. Without access controls, any user querying the application could potentially get answers from any document in that database. To solve this, the proposed architecture involves enriching the vector index with **metadata**. During the data ingestion process, each document chunk is tagged with metadata that defines its access requirements (e.g., `{\"department\": \"finance\"}` or `{\"role\": \"marketing_manager\"}`). When a user interacts with the application, they are first authenticated via an identity provider (like Amazon Cognito). Based on the user's identity or role, the application generates a corresponding **filter**. This filter, along with the user's query, is passed to the Knowledge Base. The Knowledge Base then performs a \"filtered search,\" retrieving only the document chunks where the stored metadata matches the user's filter. This ensures that the context provided to the Large Language Model (LLM) for generating a response is strictly limited to the data that the specific user is permitted to access, effectively enforcing persona-based security at the data retrieval step.",

      "summary": "This session provides a technical overview of how to defend generative AI applications against \"jailbreaking\" attacks, with a specific focus on **prompt injection**. The speaker explains that these attacks exploit the inherent tension in Large Language Models (LLMs) between their primary objectives: language modeling, instruction following, and safety. Attackers craft malicious prompts that manipulate the model into bypassing its safety training, causing it to generate harmful, toxic, or otherwise restricted content. The presentation details several common jailbreaking tactics, including: -   **Affirmative Instruction**: Tricking the model by starting a prompt with a phrase like \"Absolutely, here's how...\" to compel it to follow the malicious instruction. -   **Low-Resource Language Bypass**: Translating a malicious prompt into a language the model was not extensively trained on (e.g., Zulu) to evade safety filters that are most effective for high-resource languages like English. -   **Base64 Encoding**: Obfuscating the malicious prompt by encoding it, tricking the model into decoding and executing the harmful instruction. To counter these threats, the session outlines a layered defense-in-depth strategy using AWS services. This starts with simple **prompt engineering** (adding reminder instructions to the prompt) and moves to more robust, programmatic controls. **Amazon Comprehend** can be used to classify input prompts for toxicity or other harmful content. **Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock** provides a powerful, managed way to filter both user inputs and model outputs based on denied topics, content filters, and PII redaction. Finally, the talk introduces a more advanced technique using **perplexity scoring**—a measure of a model's \"surprise\" at a given text—to identify and block anomalous or adversarial prompts.

      "summary": "In this partner session, cybersecurity vendor **Wiz** argues for a new, integrated approach to DevSecOps that addresses the full lifecycle of risk from code to cloud, including the new challenges introduced by AI development. The central thesis is that traditional, siloed security tools—like AppSec solutions that only see code and CSPM solutions that only see the cloud—are insufficient for modern threats. Attackers exploit the gaps between these domains, chaining together vulnerabilities like an exposed secret in a GitHub repository to a misconfigured cloud resource to gain access to sensitive data. Wiz's proposed solution is a unified platform that provides **code-to-cloud correlation**. This means being able to trace a risk found in a running cloud resource back to its origin in the code and, conversely, understanding the potential cloud impact of a vulnerability found in a code repository. This deep context is the key to effective prioritization. By mapping these relationships on a \"Security Graph,\" Wiz can identify true \"toxic combinations\" or attack paths—for example, a public-facing virtual machine with a critical vulnerability that also has permissions to a sensitive data store—allowing teams to focus on the small percentage of risks that pose a genuine threat. The session then extends this philosophy to the burgeoning field of AI security, introducing the concept of **AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM)**. Wiz asserts that securing AI pipelines requires the same principles: complete visibility into all AI services and technologies in use, a risk-based approach to identify threats like model poisoning or data leakage, and contextual analysis to prioritize critical attack paths. The goal is to empower AI engineers and data scientists to own the security of their pipelines by providing them with a centralized, prioritized, and easy-to-understand view of their AI security posture.",

The presentation follows the journey of a persona named \"Saanvi,\" a security engineer who needs to investigate a publicly exposed S3 bucket. Her story demonstrates how natural language querying, powered by generative AI, removes the friction of complex query syntax and empowers engineers to get answers from their security data much faster. The first part of the investigation uses **AWS Config**. Instead of needing to know the specific SQL syntax for Config's advanced queries, Saanvi can simply type a plain-language question like, \"Show me all the non-compliant S3 buckets.\" The new feature automatically translates this into the correct SQL query, which she can then run to identify the resource of interest. This allows her to quickly pinpoint which buckets are public without having to learn the underlying table schemas or query language. The second part of the investigation moves to **AWS CloudTrail Lake** to understand the \"who, what, and when\" behind the misconfiguration. Previously, this would require Saanvi to spend significant time learning the complex structure of CloudTrail events and writing detailed SQL queries, a process fraught with trial and error. With the new generative AI feature, she can ask direct questions like, \"Show me all API actions on this S3 bucket in the last 24 hours,\" or \"Which user called the PutBucketPublicAccessBlock API?\" The service generates the precise queries for her, allowing her to rapidly identify the API call that made the bucket public, the user who made the call, and all other actions that user took, enabling a full investigation in minutes instead of hours.",

      "summary": "This session introduces the **Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix**, a framework developed by AWS to help security practitioners and developers establish a common language for discussing and managing the risks associated with different types of generative AI applications. The matrix categorizes generative AI use cases into five \"scopes\" and provides guidance across five key security domains for each. The core message is that while generative AI introduces new nuances, securing it is an extension of existing data security principles, not a radical departure. Organizations should focus on their security fundamentals (\"eating their security vegetables\") and apply them to the specific context of their AI workloads. The matrix is divided into two main categories: **Buy** and **Build**. The \"Buy\" category includes Scope 1 (consumer off-the-shelf applications like public chatbots) and Scope 2 (enterprise applications with a formal legal agreement, like Amazon Q Business). The \"Build\" category covers Scope 3 (building applications on top of pre-trained foundation models), Scope 4 (fine-tuning a model with your own data), and Scope 5 (training a model from scratch). For each scope, the session provides actionable advice across the domains of governance, legal/privacy, risk management, controls, and resilience. A key theme is that as an organization moves from buying to building, and from using pre-trained models to training their own, their security responsibility increases significantly, particularly around data protection, model integrity, and resilience.",

The core of their mission is to decommission legacy, mainframe-based monolithic systems and replace them with a modern, microservices-based, event-driven architecture that is fully deployed in the cloud. This approach allows them to provide more flexible, real-time services to their customers (banks, acquirers, and PSPs), reduce operational costs, and innovate much faster than traditional payment processors. A significant focus of the presentation is how AsapCard designed their architecture to be compliant with the stringent requirements of the **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** from the ground up. They leverage a multi-account strategy using **AWS Control Tower** and **AWS Organizations** to create a strong security foundation, with separate organizational units (OUs) for security, workloads, and infrastructure, each with its own tailored security policies. The architecture relies heavily on native AWS security and infrastructure services. **AWS PrivateLink** is used to establish secure, private connections to major card brands. **AWS WAF** and **Elastic Load Balancing** protect their APIs and application endpoints. For secrets management, they use **AWS Secrets Manager** integrated with Amazon EKS, with automated credential rotation via AWS Lambda. A key component of their PCI compliance is the use of **AWS Payment Cryptography** and **AWS CloudHSM**, which allows them to perform all necessary payment-related cryptographic operations (like key verification and encryption) in a fully managed, PCI-certified environment, without needing to own or operate physical Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).

      "summary": "This session provides a comprehensive guide to designing, building, and securing resilient event-driven architectures (EDA) on AWS. The talk is structured around three key pillars: governance, resilience, and data protection, culminating in a real-world case study from **United Airlines** on their journey from a monolithic mainframe to a modern, event-based system. The session argues that as companies modernize and decompose monolithic applications into microservices, EDA becomes a critical pattern for enabling loose coupling, independent scaling, and increased agility. The presentation first covers **governance**, advocating for a \"micro-account\" strategy where each application team or business domain owns its own AWS account. This approach enhances security through account-level boundaries, reduces blast radius, and provides better cost visibility and resource isolation compared to a single-account model. For **resilience**, the session details how to build multi-region, active-passive architectures for event-driven systems. It highlights **Amazon MSK Replicator** as a key tool for asynchronously replicating Kafka topics between regions, enabling rapid failover in the event of a regional impairment. The importance of automation, robust health checks, and managing consumer lag are emphasized as critical components of a successful disaster recovery strategy. The final section focuses on **data protection** within EDA. The speakers stress that because EDA involves a lot of data in motion between decoupled components, security must be a primary concern. The core recommendations are to encrypt data both in transit (using TLS) and at rest (using **AWS KMS**), and to implement client-side encryption where the event producer encrypts the payload before it even enters the messaging system. This ensures that sensitive data remains protected even as it flows through various brokers and routers. The session also covers the importance of data minimization—only including necessary data in events to reduce the impact of potential leaks—and using fine-grained access controls with IAM and resource policies to secure access to messaging services like Amazon MSK.",

Faced with stringent regulatory requirements and a massive cloud footprint, their primary goals were security, automated rotation, and high availability. The solution they engineered utilizes a \"centralized management with federated storage\" model, providing a single control plane for secrets while storing the secrets themselves in the individual application accounts where they are consumed. At the heart of the architecture is a central **\"Gatekeeper\" account**. This account hosts a set of APIs, built with Lambda and API Gateway, that serve as the exclusive mechanism for creating and managing all machine secrets in the organization. Application teams use a UI to call these Gatekeeper APIs, specifying what secret they need, in which account, and which IAM roles should have access to it. The Gatekeeper API then assumes a role into the target application account to create the secret in **AWS Secrets Manager**, configure its resource policy for least privilege, and record its metadata in a central DynamoDB table for auditing and compliance. A key focus of the presentation is their multi-layered approach to access control, leveraging Service Control Policies (SCPs), resource-based policies, and identity-based policies to enforce a strict security posture. This includes using SCPs to prevent humans from accessing machine secrets and ensuring all secret creation goes through the Gatekeeper. They also detail a custom, extensible rotation framework that allows individual application teams to \"bring their own\" rotation logic for their specific secrets, enabling rotation at scale without burdening a central team.",

      "summary": "This session, led by the former CEO of Dig Security (now part of Palo Alto Networks), provides a deep dive into the modern challenges of cloud data security and how to address them. The central argument is that the explosion of data across multiple clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP), diverse data stores (managed services, databases on VMs, data lakes), and the rise of AI has made traditional data security approaches obsolete. The solution presented is a comprehensive data security platform built on the principles of **Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)** and **Data Detection and Response (DDR)**. The DSPM portion of the platform focuses on answering three critical questions: What data exists? How is it being used? And how can it be protected? It achieves this through automated discovery of all data stores (both managed and unmanaged \"shadow data\" on VMs), followed by classification of the data within them. A key innovation is performing this classification in-memory on temporary snapshots within the customer's environment, ensuring that sensitive data is never moved and data residency requirements are respected. This creates a complete data inventory that is then enriched with context, including data sensitivity, access permissions, misconfigurations, and data sovereignty risks. The DDR component complements this by providing real-time analysis of data in motion. It monitors data interactions to detect anomalous activities like mass downloads, data exfiltration to other clouds, or ransomware-like encryption events. The combination of DSPM (for data at rest) and DDR (for data in use/motion) provides a holistic view of data security. The talk extends these principles to AI security, framing it as fundamentally a data security problem. The platform discovers AI services and models (SageMaker, Bedrock, etc.) and analyzes the data being fed into them, allowing organizations to govern their AI workloads by preventing sensitive or toxic data from being used in training or inference.",

      "summary": "This session, presented by cloud security company **Lacework**, argues that traditional, rule-based security approaches are no longer sufficient to keep pace with the dynamic and complex nature of modern cloud environments. The core problem is time: security teams struggle to detect and respond to threats quickly enough, especially with the rise of zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated attack techniques. The solution, as proposed by Lacework, is to leverage a combination of machine learning and generative AI to automate detection, reduce noise, and empower security teams to be more proactive and efficient. The Lacework platform is built on the principle of learning the normal behavior of a customer's cloud environment. By collecting and analyzing a massive amount of data from the entire software development lifecycle—from code and container images to the cloud control plane and runtime workloads—the platform's machine learning engine establishes a baseline of normal activity. It then surfaces anomalies and deviations from this baseline as high-fidelity alerts. This \"anomaly detection\" approach is contrasted with traditional SIEMs that rely on static rules, which can generate a high volume of false positives and alert fatigue. Lacework claims this reduces the number of critical alerts to just a handful per day, allowing teams to focus on what matters. The session also highlights Lacework's use of generative AI, powered by **Amazon Bedrock**, to further assist security analysts. When a complex \"composite alert\" (which stitches together multiple related suspicious activities) is generated, analysts can use a built-in generative AI assistant to get plain-language explanations of the threat, understand the context, and receive recommended next steps. This bridges the gap between detection and response, enabling even junior analysts to quickly triage and investigate sophisticated threats by tracing them from a runtime alert all the way back to the misconfigured Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that introduced the vulnerability.",

      "summary": "This deep-dive session details the massive, multi-year engineering effort AWS undertook to modernize the security of its service endpoints by deprecating older TLS protocols and rolling out TLS 1.3 across the entire cloud. The project involved updating over 9,000 public API endpoints for more than 200 services, raising the security bar for every API call made to AWS. The first part of the talk focuses on the successful deprecation of TLS 1.0 and 1.1. This was a critical step for compliance, as most regulatory frameworks no longer permit these outdated versions. The primary challenge was to complete this migration without disrupting the small fraction of customers (.01%, or ~185,000 accounts) still using legacy clients. To manage this, AWS built a massive serverless data pipeline using S3, Glue, and Athena to analyze over 800 billion connection records per hour from CloudTrail and service logs. This allowed them to precisely identify impacted accounts and proactively notify them, providing details like user agent and source IP to help them find and update their old clients. For cases where clients couldn't be updated (e.g., embedded devices), AWS provided a solution using Amazon CloudFront as a proxy to terminate the old TLS connection and establish a modern TLS 1.2+ connection to the backend AWS service. The second part of the session details the parallel effort to enable TLS 1.3. This protocol not only raises the security ceiling by removing obsolete cryptographic primitives but also improves performance by reducing the handshake latency from two network round-trips to one. The main challenge was ensuring compatibility across the vast and heterogeneous set of clients connecting to AWS. The rollout was managed with extreme care, using a gradual, cell-by-cell deployment model and sophisticated monitoring. Instead of just watching overall success rates, AWS engineers monitored the *rate of change* of failures and used targeted canary analysis on specific at-risk client populations (identified by their TLS \"client hello\" fingerprints) to detect subtle compatibility issues before they could cause widespread impact.",

The lifecycle is presented as an iterative, workload-by-workload process with five key stages: setting objectives, designing and implementing, evaluating and testing, operating, and responding and learning. The core message is that resilience is a shared responsibility and requires a proactive, continuous approach rather than being a one-time effort. The session emphasizes that the foundation of resilience is setting clear **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)** in collaboration with business stakeholders, as these objectives drive all subsequent architectural and operational decisions. It highlights several AWS services that support this lifecycle, including **AWS Resilience Hub** for assessing an application's posture against its RTO/RPO targets, and **AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS)** for performing managed chaos engineering experiments to validate resilience. The second half of the session features a compelling case study from **Vanguard**, one of the world's largest investment companies. They describe their journey from a traditional, on-premises model to a complex, multi-cloud, multi-region environment. This rapid modernization initially led to an increase in instability. To combat this, they adopted a continuous resilience operating model, building homegrown tools to democratize performance testing (PTAS) and fault injection (\"Climate of Chaos\").

The presentation begins by defining \"digital sovereignty\" not as a single concept, but as a set of customer expectations around **data residency**, **operational autonomy**, and **resiliency**. The European Sovereign Cloud is AWS's answer to customers who need to meet stringent regulatory and data protection requirements without compromising on the full power and functionality of the AWS platform. The new sovereign cloud will be physically and logically separate from existing commercial AWS regions, with its first region located in Brandenburg, Germany, launching at the end of 2025. A key differentiator is that it will be operated and supported exclusively by EU-resident personnel located physically within the EU. This extends to all aspects of operations, from customer service to technical support and data center management, providing an additional layer of operational autonomy and assurance against foreign government access. Crucially, the European Sovereign Cloud will not be a feature-limited or \"snowflake\" version of AWS. It is being built to offer the same architectural excellence, including a Multi-AZ design, the security of the Nitro System, and the same APIs as commercial regions. This ensures that customers can migrate and run their workloads without significant re-architecting. All customer data, including configuration metadata like IAM roles and tags, will be strictly stored within the EU, providing enhanced data residency guarantees.

      "summary": "This session, presented by the data security company **Rubrik**, addresses the growing challenge of protecting data in complex, hybrid environments against threats like ransomware. The core argument is that traditional security tools are failing to provide the necessary visibility and control, leading to boards and executives asking difficult questions about data security posture and resilience. Rubrik positions its platform as a unified solution that combines **Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)** with its established **cyber recovery** capabilities to answer these questions and protect data \"wherever it lives\"—on-premises, in AWS, and across multi-cloud and SaaS applications. The platform's DSPM capabilities focus on providing complete visibility into an organization's data landscape. It automatically discovers and classifies data across the entire estate, identifying what data is critical or sensitive, where it's located, and who has access to it. This is enriched with real-time user activity monitoring to detect anomalous behavior, such as a compromised identity attempting to exfiltrate or encrypt large amounts of data. By flagging these \"toxic combinations\" of over-privileged access and unusual activity, the platform aims to stop data breaches and ransomware attacks at the data layer, before significant damage occurs. The second pillar of the solution is cyber recovery. Rubrik emphasizes that visibility alone is not enough; organizations must be able to recover their data quickly after an attack. Their platform provides immutable, air-gapped backups and a \"$10 million ransomware recovery warranty,\" guaranteeing that customers can restore their data. By combining these two functions—proactive posture management and reactive recovery—into a single platform, Rubrik aims to provide \"cyber resilience,\" helping customers not only defend against attacks but also get back to business quickly if an incident occurs, turning a potentially catastrophic event into a manageable \"speed bump.\"",

      "author": " AWS Events",
      "summary": "This session provides a technical deep dive into the security architecture of **Amazon Bedrock**, explaining how the service is designed to protect customer data and provide granular control over the use of generative AI models. A key point is that Bedrock is not an LLM itself, but a managed service that hosts foundation models from various providers (e.g., Anthropic, Meta, Cohere) within the AWS ecosystem. This means customers interact with these models via a single, secure AWS API, and all interactions are governed by familiar AWS security controls like IAM, KMS, and VPC. The presentation details Bedrock's multi-layered security posture. At the data level, it emphasizes that customer prompts and responses are **never used to train the base foundation models** and are never shared with third-party model providers. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest using AWS KMS, with the option for customers to use their own keys. For network security, Bedrock supports **AWS PrivateLink**, allowing customers to invoke the service from their VPCs without traffic ever leaving the AWS backbone. The underlying architecture isolates model deployments into separate AWS accounts, with a clear distinction between the \"on-demand\" multi-tenant compute and the \"provisioned capacity\" single-tenant compute used for high-throughput or fine-tuned models. When a customer fine-tunes a model, the training job runs within a Bedrock service account but places an ENI into the customer's VPC, ensuring that access to the training data in S3 adheres to the customer's network controls. Finally, the talk addresses application-level security by introducing **Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock**. This feature allows customers to implement safety policies on top of any model to control its behavior. Guardrails act as a filter, evaluating both prompts and responses against a set of user-defined rules. These rules can include denying specific topics (e.g., preventing a financial chatbot from giving investment advice), filtering content for hate speech or prompt injection attacks, and, most importantly, detecting and redacting sensitive PII data using built-in or custom regex patterns. This provides a consistent, model-agnostic layer of protection to ensure responsible and secure AI application development.",

      "summary": "In this technical deep dive, AWS penetration testers present a three-layered framework for understanding and testing the security of generative AI systems. The session moves beyond high-level concepts to detail specific, novel attack vectors at each layer of the generative AI stack—infrastructure, model, and application—and provides concrete mitigation strategies for each. The presentation methodically breaks down the AI stack: 1.  **The Bottom Layer (Infrastructure)**: This layer focuses on the supply chain security of the model itself. The speakers demonstrate a critical vulnerability in the popular HDF5 (`.h5`) model format, showing how a maliciously crafted file can trigger memory corruption in the underlying C libraries used by TensorFlow and PyTorch, bypassing Python-level security. 2.  **The Middle Layer (Model & Tooling)**: This layer addresses the risks of \"agentic\" AI systems that can interact with external tools and APIs. The session illustrates a sophisticated **indirect prompt injection** attack, where a malicious product review on a third-party site is ingested by a shopping assistant AI, hijacking its logic and causing it to perform unauthorized actions (like purchasing an item) on behalf of the user. 3.  **The Top Layer (Application)**: This layer deals with user-facing interactions and the classic problem of \"jailbreaking.\" The speakers explain the threat of **adversarial suffixes**—universal, gibberish-looking strings that, when appended to a malicious prompt, can trick even state-of-the-art models into generating harmful content, bypassing their built-in safety filters. For each of these threats, the session provides a defense-in-depth strategy. Key recommendations include standardizing on secure model formats like **SafeTensors**, rigorously sanitizing all external data inputs for agentic systems, and implementing a multi-layered defense against jailbreaking using strong system prompts and services like **Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock** to filter both user inputs and model outputs.",

The presentation focuses on the powerful combination of **Amazon CloudFront**, AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN), and **AWS WAF**, the Web Application Firewall. The core message is that by deploying these services together, organizations can quickly establish a strong, baseline security posture for their web applications, protecting them from common threats while also improving performance and gaining critical security visibility. The talk highlights two primary methods for deploying this security layer, catering to different operational models. The first method, aimed at security teams, involves creating a centralized **Web ACL** (Access Control List) directly within the AWS WAF console. This allows security professionals to define a standard, reusable policy—for example, one that includes AWS Managed Rules for IP reputation, core rule sets against OWASP Top 10 threats, and known bad inputs—which can then be consistently applied to multiple CloudFront distributions. The second method demonstrates the new \"one-click\" security deployment feature directly within the CloudFront console. This streamlined workflow is designed for application and DevOps teams who need to move quickly. When creating a new CloudFront distribution, developers can now simply enable security protections, which automatically creates and attaches a WAF Web ACL with a recommended baseline set of managed rules. Both approaches emphasize starting in \"count mode\" to monitor traffic and avoid false positives before blocking requests. A key benefit highlighted is the rich, out-of-the-box visibility provided through the CloudFront security dashboard, which gives insights into bot traffic and rule matches at no additional cost.",

The speaker, a former AWS AppSec engineer, argues that to truly distribute security ownership and create a lasting culture of security, organizations must avoid common pitfalls that doom these initiatives. The talk is a practical guide for security leaders on how to get buy-in, structure a pilot, and scale the program effectively. The presentation identifies four key ways to fail, turning each into a lesson for success: 1.  **Fail by \"asking people to do the right thing.\"** The lesson is that good intentions are not enough. A successful program must be a well-defined **mechanism** with clear inputs, outputs, and a continuous cycle of adoption, inspection, and tooling. Relying on goodwill alone will not create sustainable change. 2.  **Fail by \"working backwards from the security problem.\"** The correct approach is to work backwards from the **business problem**. To get crucial top-down support, the program's vision and goals must be framed in terms of business value, such as accelerating feature launches or increasing customer trust, not just as a security initiative. 3.  **Fail by \"going too fast.\"** The lesson here is to \"think big, but start small.\" Instead of a \"big bang\" rollout across the entire organization, which can lead to analysis paralysis, leaders should **pilot the program** with a few carefully selected teams to learn, iterate, and gather data before scaling. 4.  **Fail by \"increasing headcount.\"** This addresses the mistake of trying to hire external \"Security Champions.\" The core value of a champion is their deep, existing knowledge of their team's systems and context.

      "summary": "In this partner session, **Cloud Storage Security (CSS)**, a security vendor, introduces their in-account data protection platform and announces their new capability, **GenAI Secure**. The presentation begins by outlining CSS's core philosophy, which rejects traditional agent-based or SaaS-based security models that require moving customer data out of their environment. Instead, CSS provides a solution that deploys entirely within the customer's AWS account using a serverless architecture (ECS Fargate tasks, SNS, SQS). This ensures that customer data, such as objects in S3 or EBS snapshots, never leaves their control, maintaining the security boundary of their AWS account. The core product provides event-driven scanning for malware and sensitive data in various AWS storage services. When a new object is written to a protected S3 bucket, it triggers a pipeline that uses multiple scanning engines (e.g., CrowdStrike, Sophos, ClamAV) to analyze the object. Malicious or sensitive files can then be automatically tagged and moved to a quarantine bucket for forensics. The new **GenAI Secure** feature extends this protection to generative AI workflows built on services like **Amazon Bedrock** and **SageMaker**. CSS demonstrates two primary use cases: 1.  **Protecting the Input**: Scanning the data used to fine-tune or augment foundation models (e.g., in a RAG architecture) to ensure that malicious files or sensitive data do not \"poison\" the model's knowledge base. 2.  **Protecting the Output**: Scanning the output of generative AI applications (e.g., text, documents) to ensure they are sanitized and do not contain sensitive data or PII before being delivered to end-users. Furthermore, CSS showcases how they use Amazon Bedrock internally to enhance their own product. This includes a \"Malware Analysis Report\" that uses a Bedrock model to generate a plain-language explanation of what a malicious file does and a \"Policy Helper\" that uses natural language prompts to generate complex regular expressions for custom sensitive data policies.",

Drawing a parallel to the evolution of performance testing, which successfully moved from slow, expensive, and inaccurate pre-production setups to real-time monitoring in production, he contends that AppSec can follow the same path. The core thesis is that testing in production is not only more efficient but also cheaper, faster, and significantly more accurate because it leverages real user traffic in the real application environment. The key enabler for this shift is a new generation of highly efficient, low-overhead security agents that can be safely deployed in production. These agents, like the one from Contrast Security, use runtime instrumentation to analyze an application's behavior as it executes. When the agent detects a dangerous operation, such as executing a SQL query, it inspects the data flowing into that operation. If the data is untrusted and unsanitized, the agent can both report the underlying vulnerability to developers and, if the input resembles an attack, block it in real-time. This provides the benefits of multiple tools—SAST (code scanning), SCA (dependency analysis), and RASP/WAF (runtime protection)—directly within the application, effectively turning the production environment into a continuous security testing ground.",

        "**Enabling Technology**: The shift is made possible by highly efficient, low-resource security agents that run inside the application in production without significant performance impact.",
        "**How it Works**: The agent instruments the application at runtime.

        "**Trust Boundary Enforcement**: For a dangerous operation like `execute SQL`, the agent injects a check (`RuntimeProtectionModule.enforceTrustBoundary`) before the call.",
        "**Dynamic Sampling**: To minimize performance overhead, the agent uses dynamic sampling, effectively turning itself off once it has gathered the information it needs about a particular code path. This results in a resource consumption of a fraction of 1%.",

The solution combines the application performance monitoring (APM) capabilities of **Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals** with the AI-powered scanning of **Amazon CodeGuru Security** and the generative AI power of **Amazon Bedrock**. The goal is to dramatically shorten the time it takes to detect, investigate, and remediate security vulnerabilities by creating a single, correlated view of application health and security posture. The presentation outlines a complete, event-driven architecture. When a developer pushes code, a CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers CodeGuru to scan for a wide range of vulnerabilities. When a finding is detected, an event is sent to Amazon EventBridge, which kicks off two parallel processes. First, a Lambda function sends metrics about the vulnerability (e.g., severity, count) to CloudWatch, allowing teams to create **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** to track their security posture over time (e.g., \"number of critical vulnerabilities must be zero\"). Second, and most powerfully, another Lambda function uses Amazon Bedrock to automate remediation. This function takes the vulnerability details and code snippets from the CodeGuru finding, prompts an LLM (Claude 3 Sonnet in the demo) to generate the corrected code, and then automatically opens a pull request with the suggested fix.

      "summary": "This session, presented by security vendor **Snyk**, reveals the significant disconnect between the rapid, often unauthorized, adoption of generative AI coding tools and the lack of corresponding security preparation within organizations. Drawing on their 2024 \"AI Readiness Report,\" which surveyed developers, AppSec professionals, and C-suite executives, Snyk argues that while AI adoption is inevitable, the current approach creates a perfect storm of risk. The core message is that organizations must move from a reactive state to a proactive one by establishing clear processes, policies, and technical guardrails. The research highlights three critical findings. First, there is a dramatic perception gap: the C-suite is five times more likely than AppSec teams to believe AI coding tools are \"not risky at all\" and twice as likely as developers to feel \"extremely ready\" for adoption. Second, despite widespread awareness that developers are using these tools without authorization, most organizations paradoxically describe their existing security policies as \"adequate.\" Third, there is a profound lack of preparation, with fewer than 20% of organizations running a Proof of Concept (POC) before adoption, and two-thirds of developers receiving little to no training on how to use these new tools securely. To address this, Snyk provides a clear \"how-to\" guide for secure AI adoption. They advocate for a disciplined, process-oriented approach centered on four key recommendations: 1.  **Run a Proof of Concept (POC)** to define success metrics and properly balance the benefits of innovation against the inherent security risks. 2.  **Listen to the Application Security Team**, as they have the most realistic view of the organization's security posture and the impact of AI-generated code. 3.  **Facilitate Cross-Functional Communication** between developers, security, and business leaders to ensure alignment. 4.  **Implement Technical Guardrails**, such as SAST scanning tools, to manage the increased volume of code and the vulnerabilities that will be introduced.",

      "summary": "This deep-dive session from the Amazon Q engineering team explains how AWS is leveraging generative AI to embed security directly into the developer workflow, a concept known as \"shift-left\" security. The presentation details how **Amazon Q Developer** acts as an AI-powered coding companion that not only helps write code but also actively works to make that code secure from the very beginning. The core of the strategy is a single, powerful Static Application Security Testing (SAST) engine that is integrated across the entire AWS developer toolchain—from the IDE (Amazon Q) to the CI/CD pipeline (Amazon CodeGuru Security) and into production workloads (Amazon Inspector). The talk addresses the key pain points of traditional SAST tools, such as high false positive rates, inconsistent findings across different tools, and the developer friction caused by context switching. Amazon Q's approach aims to solve these problems by making security an ambient, helpful part of the coding experience. It features an **auto-scan** capability that runs continuously in the background of the IDE, flagging potential vulnerabilities as the developer types, without requiring a manual scan. When a vulnerability is found, Q provides not just a description but also an **\"Explain with Q\"** feature that offers a detailed, conversational explanation of the risk, and a one-click **\"Auto-Fix\"** that uses generative AI to create and apply a code patch directly in the editor. By providing a consistent, low-friction, and intelligent security experience, AWS aims to empower developers to become the first line of defense, fixing vulnerabilities earlier in the lifecycle when it is fastest and cheapest to do so.",

The presentation walks through a typical RAG architecture and systematically identifies five key security risks, then proposes specific AWS services and architectural patterns to mitigate each one. The core message is that while RAG is a powerful and efficient way to customize generative AI with private data, it introduces new security challenges that must be addressed to protect sensitive information. The talk outlines a secure architecture that hardens the RAG pipeline at every step. It begins with network security, advocating for the use of **AWS Direct Connect** or a VPN to securely upload internal data to S3, rather than using the public internet. For the application's public-facing endpoint, it recommends using **AWS WAF** to protect against DDoS attacks and malicious traffic. To enforce network isolation for the backend components, the session emphasizes using **VPC endpoints** to ensure all traffic between services like Bedrock and S3 stays within the AWS network. The presentation then dives deep into data protection. To prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive data in the RAG knowledge base, it showcases **Amazon Macie**, which can automatically scan the S3 buckets used as data sources and detect PII or custom-defined sensitive data patterns. Finally, to control the output of the language model itself, the session introduces **Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock**.

      "summary": "This session, presented by **SentinelOne**, provides a stark overview of the modern cloud threat landscape and makes the case for a unified, AI-powered approach to security. The speaker argues that cloud attacks are rapidly increasing in both volume and sophistication, with adversaries now specifically targeting cloud infrastructure and abusing native cloud services to achieve their goals. This creates a complex environment where traditional, siloed security tools fail, leading to alert fatigue, operational friction between teams, and ultimately, successful breaches. The presentation details a variety of modern threats, including automated botnets (LemonDuck), supply chain attacks targeting developers (Lazarus Group), and the rise of Linux-focused ransomware. A key case study on the **Roasted Oktapus (Scattered Spider)** group illustrates a sophisticated attack chain that involved smishing for SSO credentials, pivoting from Azure AD to AWS, using Systems Manager for discovery, disabling GuardDuty, and ultimately deploying ransomware. These examples highlight a common pattern: attackers are \"living off the land\" by manipulating legitimate cloud services, a technique the speaker calls \"cloud LOLbins.\" The proposed solution is SentinelOne's AI-powered Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP), which combines agent-less and agent-based security. The agent-less component goes beyond theoretical \"attack paths\" by using an **Offensive Security Engine** to create **Verified Exploit Paths**. This engine runs a defanged, dynamic attack to prove that a misconfiguration is truly exploitable, providing concrete evidence (e.g., a screenshot of stolen credentials) to prioritize remediation. This is complemented by an agent-based runtime security solution that uses machine learning to detect and block threats at machine speed, providing a critical layer of defense for when preventative measures fail.",

Their strategy is centered on three core pillars: secrets management, data encryption, and certificate management. The primary goal was to reduce the operational burden on application teams by automating security processes, allowing developers to focus on business logic while ensuring a strong, compliant security posture. The cornerstone of their solution is an **event-driven lifecycle management** system for secrets. Using **AWS Secrets Manager**, they created a framework where the creation of a new resource (like an RDS database) automatically triggers an **EventBridge** rule. This rule invokes a Lambda function that provisions the necessary service accounts and onboards their credentials into Secrets Manager under a strict, predefined namespace. To simplify adoption, they even developed a custom JDBC wrapper that allows Java applications to connect to databases by transparently fetching credentials from Secrets Manager at runtime, abstracting the complexity from developers. For data encryption, Fannie Mae mandates the use of **Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)** in **AWS KMS** instead of default service-managed keys. This provides a \"double layer of protection,\" as accessing data requires permissions for both the data resource itself and the specific KMS key used to encrypt it. They enforce a \"vertical segmentation\" model, where each application workload has its own dedicated KMS key. For disaster recovery, they leverage multi-region keys to ensure data remains accessible after a failover. This comprehensive approach, combining automated secret lifecycle management with granular, workload-specific encryption, allows Fannie Mae to maintain a high level of security and compliance for their critical financial data in the cloud.",

The presentation addresses the top security concern for many organizations: leaked credentials, which are the root cause of the vast majority of web application breaches. HashiCorp's solution is a three-pronged approach—\"Protect, Inspect, and Connect\"—implemented through two of their core products, **HashiCorp Vault** and **HashiCorp Boundary**. The workflow begins with **inspecting** the environment to tackle secret sprawl. A new offering, **Vault Radar**, scans up to 18 different data sources (like GitHub or Confluence) to find and flag hardcoded secrets, providing a dashboard and Slack alerts for remediation. Once found, the secrets are moved under central management to **protect** them within **HashiCorp Vault**. This allows for governance and control, but the true security improvement comes from evolving beyond static secrets. The core of the strategy is to leverage Vault's ability to generate **dynamic, short-lived credentials**. These just-in-time secrets are created for a specific session and expire automatically, dramatically reducing the risk of a long-lived credential being compromised. To **connect** users to systems, **HashiCorp Boundary** provides least-privilege, identity-based access without exposing credentials. The final step integrates the two products: when a user authenticates via Boundary to access a resource (e.g., via SSH), Boundary requests a dynamic credential from Vault, which is then seamlessly injected into the session. The user gets secure access without ever seeing or handling a password. For compliance and forensics, Boundary can also record the entire SSH session for playback.",

      "summary": "This session, presented by a cloud security engineer from **Cisco**, provides a practical guide on how to use **AWS Signer** to enhance software supply chain security for both serverless functions and containers. The core principle is using code signing to create a verifiable link—or **build attribution**—between a deployed artifact and the trusted CI/CD pipeline that produced it. This ensures that any artifact running in production has passed all required security scans and has not been tampered with since its creation, providing a critical layer of defense and satisfying compliance requirements. For **AWS Lambda**, the integration is straightforward. The build pipeline makes a single API call to Signer after uploading the code to S3. At deployment time, a `CodeSigningConfig` is attached to the Lambda function, which tells the Lambda service to automatically validate the signature before accepting the deployment. Any unsigned or tampered artifact is rejected. For **containers on ECS**, the process is more involved as ECS lacks the native integration that Lambda has. Signing is performed using the open-source **Notation CLI** with an AWS plugin, which coordinates with Signer to create and store the signature in ECR. To ensure validation, a two-part process is required: 1.  **Deploy-time Validation**: A verification step is added to the CI/CD pipeline that uses the Notation CLI to check the signature of every container in an ECS task definition *before* it is deployed. 2.  **Post-deployment Validation**: To catch containers that might bypass the pipeline, a CloudWatch event triggers a Lambda function that uses the **Notation Go API** to continuously verify the signatures of running tasks, alerting on any anomalies.",

The core message is that by integrating generative AI across the entire workflow—from internal knowledge discovery and documentation to the console and IDE—teams can significantly reduce friction and move faster. The demo begins with **Amazon Q Business**, which acts as a centralized knowledge base, allowing the engineer to instantly query internal systems like Jira and Confluence to understand the history and context of the vulnerable application. Next, the engineer uses **Amazon Q in the AWS Documentation and Console** to quickly learn about AWS security best practices, identify issues like unpatched container vulnerabilities in ECR, and get recommendations for remediation, such as using a smaller base image. The bulk of the session takes place in the IDE, showcasing the power of **Amazon Q Developer**. The engineer runs a security scan that immediately identifies multiple issues like SQL injection and hardcoded passwords. Q not only suggests a one-click fix but also provides in-context help for implementing the fix (e.g., how to inject secrets in ECS). The engineer then uses Q's code generation and conversational refactoring capabilities to implement the required business logic changes, such as adding input validation and converting a SQL `INSERT` to an `UPSERT`.

      "summary": "In this highly technical session, an engineer from the AWS Automated Reasoning Group provides a deep dive into the principles and practice of verifying software correctness using formal methods. The talk explains how automated reasoning tools can mathematically prove that code is free from certain classes of bugs, offering a level of assurance that is impossible to achieve through traditional testing alone. The session focuses specifically on **Kani**, an open-source verification tool developed at Amazon for the **Rust** programming language. The core of the presentation explains that automated reasoning works by translating a program's source code and its specifications into a formal mathematical model. Sophisticated algorithms, known as SAT and SMT solvers, then analyze this model to either prove that a property (like \"this function will never panic\") holds true for *all possible inputs*, or produce a concrete counterexample (a specific set of inputs) that demonstrates how the property can be violated. This is contrasted with testing, which can only check a finite number of inputs and thus cannot prove the absence of bugs. The session highlights Kani's specific strengths, particularly its ability to verify **`unsafe` Rust code**. While Rust's compiler provides strong safety guarantees for \"safe\" code, the `unsafe` keyword allows developers to bypass these checks for performance-critical operations, placing the burden of ensuring memory safety and correctness entirely on the developer. Kani is designed to formally verify these `unsafe` blocks, proving properties like the absence of memory errors, integer overflows, and other undefined behaviors. The talk showcases real-world examples of how Kani has been used internally at AWS to find subtle bugs in critical open-source projects like Firecracker and S2N-QUIC.",
      "key_points": [
        "**Automated Reasoning vs. Testing**: Testing can show the presence of bugs by running code with specific inputs, but it can never prove their absence for all possible inputs. Automated reasoning analyzes a formal model of the code to provide mathematical proof of correctness across the entire input space.",
        "**Symbolic Execution**: This is the key technique used by tools like Kani. Instead of concrete values, the program is \"executed\" with symbolic variables. The tool tracks the constraints on these variables through different code paths, building a logical formula that represents the program's behavior.",
        "**Kani for Rust**: Kani is an open-source tool from AWS that specializes in the formal verification of Rust code. It allows developers to write \"proof harnesses\" (similar to test harnesses) to check for panics, assert custom properties, and verify code correctness.",
        "**Verifying `unsafe` Rust**: Kani's primary value proposition is its ability to analyze `unsafe` Rust code. This is critical because many foundational libraries in the Rust ecosystem (including the standard library) use `unsafe` blocks for performance, and their correctness is paramount for the entire ecosystem.",

      "summary": "In this technical deep-dive, a principal engineer from the Amazon S3 security team demystifies S3 presigned URLs, clarifying what they are, when to use them, and how to mitigate their inherent risks. The session begins by correcting a common misconception: an S3 presigned URL is not just a standard signed AWS request. It differs in two key ways: it relaxes the strict five-minute validity window of a normal request by allowing a custom expiration time, and it moves all signature components from HTTP headers into URL query parameters. This makes it a self-contained, portable URL that can be used by clients without any AWS credentials or SDKs. The talk outlines the primary use cases for presigned URLs, such as granting temporary access to anonymous users, supporting resource-constrained IoT devices, or enabling generic clients like web browsers to upload or download content directly. However, the session's core focus is on the security implications. Presigned URLs are **bearer tokens**; anyone who possesses one can use it, and the resulting action is logged as the original signer, providing no visibility into who actually used the URL. To mitigate these risks, the speaker emphasizes several best practices: always adhere to the principle of least privilege for the signing identity, keep the URL's expiration time as short as possible, and use temporary session credentials for signing. The session concludes by presenting modern alternatives like **CloudFront signed cookies** for web content and the newer **S3 Access Grants** feature, which provides a more robust and auditable way to vend temporary credentials to users who have identities in a corporate directory.",

      "summary": "In this partner session, CyberArk addresses the escalating challenge of securing identities in the cloud, focusing specifically on developers and their applications. The presentation highlights the explosion of machine identities (a 45:1 ratio to human identities) and the persistent risk of over-privileged developers as major security concerns. CyberArk's core message is that traditional, on-premises privileged access management (PAM) models are insufficient for modern cloud and DevOps workflows. Their Identity Security Platform aims to solve this by applying the right level of privilege controls to the right persona, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all \"vault\" approach. The talk is split into two main parts. The first focuses on securing **human developer access** by implementing a **Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP)** model. Instead of developers having persistent, standing admin rights in AWS accounts, they start with no access. Using the CyberArk platform, a developer requests temporary, on-demand access to a specific AWS account. The platform provisions the necessary permissions just-in-time and then removes them when the session ends, drastically reducing the attack surface. The second part of the talk addresses **machine identity** and secrets management with their **Secrets Hub** product. This solution tackles the problem of \"vault sprawl\" by discovering all the native secret stores in an environment (like AWS Secrets Manager), centralizing their management, and automating the rotation of those secrets from a central policy engine, all without forcing developers to change their code or deviate from using the native services.",

        "**Frictionless Native Experience**: A key theme is that security controls for developers must be seamless and not disrupt their native workflows.

      "summary": "In this customer case study, the Cloud Security Manager from **PicPay**, a large Brazilian fintech company, details how they solved the critical challenge of managing emergency administrative access to their production AWS environments. Faced with rapid growth—managing over 200 AWS accounts and 2,000 users—PicPay needed to prevent untracked, high-privilege changes in production that could cause downtime or introduce security risks. Their goal was to move away from standing administrative access and implement a just-in-time (JIT) permissions model. With the help of AWS Professional Services, PicPay implemented **AWS TEAM (Temporary Elevated Access Management)**, an open-source solution that provides a framework for time-bound, audited, and approval-based access. In their architecture, developers have standing, long-term permissions via IAM Identity Center to make changes in non-production environments. However, the production accounts are locked down with restrictive Service Control Policies (SCPs) that prevent changes to foundational services. To make a change in production, a developer must now use the TEAM solution to request temporary elevated access. The request is routed to their business unit's manager for approval. If approved, the developer receives temporary credentials (for a maximum of four hours) with a standard, elevated permission set. Every action taken during this temporary session is logged in AWS CloudTrail, providing clear auditability and helping to reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by making it easy to identify exactly who changed what, and when.",

Using the metaphor of a \"power hour\" gym workout, the talk guides the audience through the fundamentals of IAM policy evaluation, the balance between security and developer agility, and the tools available to achieve least privilege. The session emphasizes the shared responsibility model in the context of access control: AWS's job is to enforce the policies customers write, and the customer's job is to define and refine those policies. The presentation details how to use different policy types to create robust security postures. A key focus is on establishing a **data perimeter** using Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent data exfiltration and restrict access to trusted identities and resources within an AWS Organization. The speaker demonstrates how an SCP can block a developer from accessing an S3 bucket outside the organization, even if their IAM role has permissions to do so. The session also covers the importance of correctly configuring resource-based policies to avoid the \"confused deputy\" problem, using condition keys like `aws:SourceArn` and `aws:SourceAccount`. A significant portion of the talk is dedicated to the capabilities of **IAM Access Analyzer**, highlighting how it helps developers set, verify, and refine permissions.

The core argument of the talk is that security is fundamentally a **people and process challenge**, not just a technical one. Achieving a secure environment isn't about the number of controls you have, but about how well your processes work with the people who have to follow them. If security is too burdensome, users will always find a way around it, often creating even greater risks. To tackle the problem of long-lived static keys, the Block security team focused on empathy and enablement rather than enforcement. They treated their internal developers as customers, seeking to understand their needs and provide solutions that made the secure path the easiest path. Instead of just telling teams to stop using keys, they provided modern, secure alternatives like federation, role assumption, and **IAM Roles Anywhere** for on-prem workloads. Crucially, they operationalized these alternatives through **automation**, creating simple Terraform modules that developers could drop into their code to handle federation without needing to become security experts. By combining this technical enablement with a data-driven approach that identified and focused on the small number of teams responsible for the majority of keys, they were able to achieve a massive reduction in static credentials in less than a year.",

The core challenge was to replace the engine that processes over a billion API requests per second with a new one, without any noticeable impact on customers. The key to this success was **automated reasoning**, a field of computer science that uses mathematical logic and algorithms to construct proofs about software correctness. The presentation explains the \"Automated Reasoning Development Cycle,\" which parallels the standard software development cycle but with added steps for formal specification and proof. The team used the **Dafny** programming language to write a simple, easy-to-understand **specification** of how IAM policy evaluation *should* work (e.g., \"deny trumps allow\"). They then wrote a highly performant **implementation** of the same logic. The final and most critical step was using Dafny's theorem prover to mathematically **prove** that the high-performance implementation would behave identically to the simple specification for all possible inputs. This foundational proof provided an extremely high degree of confidence that the new engine was correct. To be absolutely certain, the team then ran the new, proven engine in shadow mode, validating its decisions against the production engine on over **one quadrillion** real-world API calls before the final, seamless launch.

The presentation addresses the core security challenges of enterprise AI: ensuring users only see data they are authorized to see, and maintaining the privacy of individual user conversations. The solution presented leverages a user's existing identity provider (like Entra ID) and corporate data sources (like Confluence or SharePoint) to provide a secure, context-aware chat experience. The architecture works by using Amazon Q's built-in connectors to ingest not only the content from enterprise data sources but also the **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** associated with that content. This ACL information is stored alongside the vectorized content in the Amazon Q index. On the user side, an organization's identity provider is synchronized with AWS IAM Identity Center using SCIM. When an authenticated user asks a question, Amazon Q Business uses their identity from IAM Identity Center to filter the retrieved documents from its index, ensuring that only content the user is permitted to see (according to the ingested ACLs) is used to generate an answer.

The presentation emphasizes that as online business grows, so does the threat of account takeover (ATO), which has become a primary risk. The core strategy advocated is a defense-in-depth approach, using multiple security controls at different stages of the identity lifecycle to detect and block malicious actors. The talk outlines a three-layer security model for Cognito. The first layer is the **network perimeter**, using **AWS WAF** to block volumetric attacks, apply rate limiting, and perform geo-fencing before traffic ever reaches Cognito. The second layer is Cognito's own **threat detection services**, specifically the **advanced security features**. These features provide risk-based adaptive authentication, compromised credential detection, and device fingerprinting to assess the risk of each sign-in attempt and challenge or block high-risk events. The third layer is **custom business logic** implemented via **Cognito Lambda triggers**, which allows for integration with third-party verification services or the enforcement of custom validation rules before a user is created or authenticated. The session features a compelling customer case study from **Dynata**, the world's largest first-party data provider. With over 70 million users across 200+ websites, Dynata was facing millions of daily credential stuffing attacks against their homegrown authentication systems.

The session identifies that despite years of experience, organizations still struggle with IAM due to the increasing complexity of cloud environments, tool sprawl, and overwhelming alert fatigue. The talk advocates for a \"back to basics\" approach grounded in observability (logs, metrics, traces) to fight against overly permissive IAM policies. It highlights how native tools like **AWS IAM Access Analyzer** and third-party Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) tools like **Datadog CIEM** can help teams achieve true least privilege. The key capability showcased is the ability to analyze actual IAM usage data from CloudTrail or IAM Access Analyzer to identify the \"permissions gap\"—the difference between what a role is *allowed* to do and what it *actually* does. By detecting unused permissions, administrative privileges, and large blast radii, these tools can provide developers with actionable, down-scoped policy suggestions that reduce risk without creating friction.

      "summary": "This deep-dive session explains the modern AWS pattern for managing fine-grained data access at scale, centered on a capability called **trusted identity propagation**. The core problem addressed is that traditional IAM role-based access control (RBAC) is often insufficient for multi-tenant data analytics. When multiple users with different data access entitlements use a shared compute resource (like an EMR cluster or a Redshift warehouse), the resource's IAM role must have the superset of all users' permissions. This breaks the principle of least privilege and makes auditing difficult, as CloudTrail logs show the compute role's ARN, not the end user's identity. The solution is to decouple the compute layer from the authorization decision. Instead of embedding permissions in the compute role, **AWS IAM Identity Center** is used to bring user and group information from an external identity provider (like Okta or Entra ID) into AWS. Services like **AWS Lake Formation** and **Amazon Redshift** can then use this identity information to make dynamic, per-query authorization decisions. With trusted identity propagation, a user authenticates to an application (e.g., a Redshift query editor), and their identity context is securely passed all the way through the query engine to the data layer. Lake Formation then consults its own grant table—which maps directory users and groups to specific data resources (databases, tables, columns)—to decide if that specific user is allowed to access the data in that specific query. This allows organizations to manage a single set of permissions in one place (Lake Formation) that is enforced consistently across multiple query engines (Redshift, EMR, Athena), while also providing end-to-end auditability with the actual user's identity in CloudTrail.",

        "**Centralized, Fine-Grained Permissions**: Lake Formation becomes the single source of truth for data access permissions. You can define grants at the database, table, column, and row level, and these grants are based on the users and groups from your corporate identity provider.",
        "**End-to-End Auditing**: Because the user's identity is propagated, AWS CloudTrail logs for data access events (e.g., from S3) will contain the ARN of the end user, not just the ARN of the compute role, finally answering the question of \"who accessed what?\""

Citing analysis that shows nearly half of all identities have sensitive permissions but only 8% ever use them, the talk proposes a more scalable, centralized approach using **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**. Instead of trying to perfect every IAM role, the strategy is to use SCPs to create broad, preventative guardrails that deny high-risk activities by default and then grant exceptions only as needed. The core of the Sonrai strategy is a four-part model implemented via SCPs. First, they identify approximately 1,000 sensitive, high-impact permissions and deny them globally, then use analytics to grant specific exemptions only to the small percentage of identities that actually use them. Second, for \"zombie\" identities (those unused for 90+ days), they apply a \"deny all\" policy at the SCP level to neutralize them without having to delete them, which is often difficult due to operational fears. Third, they deny access to entire AWS services that an organization doesn't use. Finally, they implement a \"permissions on demand\" workflow. When a developer or automation legitimately needs a denied sensitive permission, the SCP block triggers an alert. This kicks off a ChatOps workflow (e.g., in Slack) where the developer can request and receive a temporary exemption within seconds, ensuring security doesn't block productivity.",

      "summary": "This session, led by the CPO of security startup **Upwind Security**, argues that the complexity of modern cloud environments requires a fundamental shift in security tooling. The core problem is that traditional, siloed security tools create friction between development, security, and operations teams, leading to slow response times and an insecure posture. The solution is to move towards a unified Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) that **bridges build-time and runtime intelligence** to provide a single, correlated view of risk. The presentation outlines the evolution of cloud security, from basic perimeter defense to the current state of tool proliferation (posture management, vulnerability scanning, threat detection, etc.). This has resulted in security teams being overwhelmed with alerts and data from disconnected systems, making it nearly impossible to prioritize what truly matters. The speaker contends that a successful security strategy must be built on three pillars: 1.  **Comprehensive Discovery**: A platform must have visibility into every layer of the cloud infrastructure, including VMs, containers, managed services, and process-level activity. 2.  **Contextual Prioritization**: It's not enough to simply aggregate alerts. The platform must correlate data from different domains (e.g., posture, identity, vulnerabilities, runtime behavior) to identify the most critical risks. 3.  **Proactive, Automated Security**: The goal is to \"shift left and shift right simultaneously,\" using runtime context to inform build-time security and build-time context to accelerate runtime incident response. Upwind's CNAPP is presented as an implementation of this philosophy. A key feature highlighted is its ability to reduce alert noise by up to 95%. It does this by analyzing runtime data to determine which vulnerabilities are actually loaded into memory and reachable in a production environment. This allows developers to focus on fixing the small percentage of CVEs that pose a real, immediate threat, rather than being overwhelmed by a list of thousands of theoretical vulnerabilities.

The presentation addresses the common customer need for a web presence that is fast, highly available, and secure against common web threats. The solution is to use CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN) to cache content closer to end-users, which improves performance and provides a distributed defense against DDoS attacks, and then to layer AWS WAF on top for application-level security. The core of the presentation demonstrates two distinct workflows for implementing this pattern, catering to different personas within an organization: 1.  **For the Security Team**: This demo shows how to create a baseline security policy directly within the AWS WAF console. The security professional builds a Web ACL containing a set of recommended **AWS Managed Rules (AMRs)**—specifically, the Amazon IP reputation list, the Core rule set (covering OWASP Top 10), and the Known bad inputs rule set. This Web ACL can then be saved and associated with any CloudFront distribution, providing a centralized, reusable security policy. 2.  **For the DevOps/NetOps Team**: This demo showcases the streamlined \"one-click\" security feature directly within the CloudFront console. When creating a new distribution, the user can simply enable security protections. This automatically applies the same three core AWS Managed Rules, with optional one-click additions for SQLi protection and rate limiting. This simplifies the process for teams who may not be WAF experts but still need to apply a strong security baseline.

The solution combines **AWS PrivateLink** for secure connectivity and the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern for providing accurate, context-aware responses. The first part of the talk explains how to secure the network layer. By default, API calls to services like Amazon Bedrock traverse the public internet. To solve this, the speaker demonstrates how to use **AWS PrivateLink** to create a private endpoint for the Bedrock API within your VPC. This ensures that all traffic between your application and the Bedrock service account remains on the private Amazon network, satisfying security and compliance requirements for sensitive data. The second part addresses the functional challenges of foundation models, such as hallucinations and lack of domain-specific knowledge. The presentation introduces RAG as the most common and cost-effective method for customizing model outputs. The RAG process involves two workflows: 1.  **Data Ingestion**: Taking a corpus of proprietary documents (e.g., PDFs), chunking them into smaller pieces, creating vector embeddings using a model like Amazon Titan, and storing these embeddings in a vector store like Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. 2.  **Text Generation**: When a user asks a question, the application creates an embedding of the query, performs a semantic search against the vector store to find relevant document chunks, and then injects this retrieved context into the prompt before sending it to the foundation model. The final architecture brings these concepts together using services like Lambda for processing, S3 for storage, and LangChain as the orchestration framework.

Fortra advocates for moving away from managing dozens of disparate security tools towards a unified, platform-based approach. Their strategy is built on three pillars: **Unification**, **Standardization**, and **Harmonization**. By unifying telemetry from all their security products (DLP, XDR, WAF, email protection, etc.) into a common data framework like OCSF, they can standardize the data and use it to train a central \"threat brain.\" This allows them to harmonize detection and protection capabilities across all layers, meaning a threat detected in one customer's environment (e.g., a malicious file hash via DLP) instantly improves the security posture for all customers. The presentation also highlights the importance of the AWS shared responsibility model and the value of partnering with validated security vendors. AWS provides the tools, but the customer is responsible for using them correctly. By engaging with an AWS-validated partner, such as one with a Level 1 MSSP competency, customers can share the risk and responsibility, offloading the management of core security functions to experts. This frees up their internal teams to focus on specialized security tasks that are unique to their business, ultimately achieving verifiable security outcomes rather than just managing a collection of tools.",

      "summary": "This session provides a rare, behind-the-scenes look at how AWS proactively discovers and mitigates emerging threats to protect the cloud and its customers, often before these threats become public knowledge. The presentation centers on **MadPot**, a global fleet of advanced honeypots that AWS uses to attract and analyze malicious activity. Unlike simple honeypots, MadPot emulates hundreds of services (from Telnet to Postgres to specific web applications) and mimics the fingerprints of commonly targeted devices. This allows AWS to not just detect probes, but to engage with threat actors, capture their full TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), extract malware payloads, and trace activity back to command-and-control (C2) servers. The speakers, a security engineer and a data scientist, detail a \"virtuous cycle\" of threat intelligence. The data harvested from MadPot is used to: 1.  **Disrupt Botnets**: By identifying C2 servers, AWS can block outbound communication from any compromised instance on its network, effectively neutralizing the bot. They also share this intelligence with external hosting providers to facilitate takedowns at the source. 2.  **Stay Ahead of the News Cycle**: The session highlights a recent case where AWS detected and deployed global network mitigations against a widespread VPN brute-force campaign more than two weeks before it was publicly reported by security firms like Cisco Talos and Okta. This was achieved by rapidly deploying new MadPot sensors emulating the targeted VPN services and building automated analytics to block the attackers in near real-time. 3.  **Measure and Validate Protection**: AWS uses a clever A/B testing methodology with MadPot, running both a \"protected\" fleet of honeypots behind their network mitigations and an \"unprotected\" fleet. By comparing the attack traffic reaching each fleet, they can statistically measure the effectiveness of their defenses. This analysis confirmed a 96% reduction in VPN brute-force attempts against customers as a result of their proactive measures. The session concludes by explaining how this internal threat intelligence is productized to benefit customers directly through services like the **Amazon IP Reputation List**, a managed rule group for AWS WAF that is continuously updated with data from MadPot.",

      "summary": "This session tells the story of how Australian e-commerce retailer **Catch** went from being the victim of a debilitating Layer 7 DDoS attack to implementing a robust, cost-effective bot mitigation strategy using AWS native services. Initially, Catch was taken offline by a request flood that was 11 times their normal traffic. Their post-incident review revealed two key gaps: they were using AWS Shield Standard, which only protects against Layer 3 and 4 attacks, and their existing AWS WAF rules were all in \"count\" mode, offering no actual protection. This incident prompted Catch to evaluate the web application protection (WAP) market. While they considered several all-in-one, \"white glove\" third-party solutions, they were deterred by the high, fixed costs, with starting prices around a quarter of a million dollars annually. As a cost-conscious retailer, they re-evaluated the AWS native solution. By calculating the total cost of ownership (TCO), they determined that even with the initial engineering effort, using AWS WAF and Shield Advanced would be twice as cheap in the first year and four times cheaper every year thereafter. The core of their new strategy revolved around implementing **AWS WAF Bot Control**. The presentation details their methodical approach: 1.  **Start in Count Mode**: They enabled the Bot Control rule group in count mode to gather data without impacting legitimate traffic. 2.  **Analyze and Baseline**: They used CloudWatch metrics to understand the bot traffic hitting their site, identifying which bots were being blocked and which were being challenged. 3.  **Targeted Rule Creation**: Based on the data, they created custom rules to explicitly allow known good bots (like Googlebot) and to apply CAPTCHA challenges to specific, high-value endpoints like the login page. 4.  **Gradual Rollout**: They moved the Bot Control rule from count to block mode, carefully monitoring the impact. The results were significant: they blocked over 26 million bot requests in the first week, saw a 16% reduction in traffic to their origin, and improved their security posture without negatively impacting their customer experience or incurring the high costs of a third-party vendor.",

      "author": " AWS Events",
      "summary": "In this session, **H2O.ai**, a leading AI and automated machine learning company, shares its journey of modernizing its cloud security posture by partnering with **Upwind**. H2O.ai faced several challenges with its previous, agentless cloud security solution: it was costly, generated a high volume of uncontextualized and noisy alerts, and created a silo between the security and DevOps teams. The DevOps team found it difficult to translate the security-focused findings into actionable engineering tasks. To address these issues, H2O.ai migrated to Upwind, a cloud security platform that provides end-to-end visibility and runtime security intelligence. A key differentiator for H2O.ai was Upwind's **DevOps-oriented approach**. The platform presents security findings with rich runtime context, making them directly actionable for platform engineers. A critical feature highlighted is the \"vulnerability funnel,\" which reduced over 2,000 potential vulnerabilities down to just seven critical, exploitable ones by analyzing if the vulnerable package was actually loaded in memory and exposed to the internet. This context-driven prioritization significantly reduced noise and allowed the team to focus on real risks. The session details several key capabilities that H2O.ai now leverages: 1.  **Simplified Deployment**: Upwind's single, eBPF-based agent was easier and faster to deploy across their EKS clusters compared to the multiple components required by their previous \"agentless\" vendor. 2.  **Runtime Context**: The platform provides a real-time network map of the entire environment, showing all services, their connections, and associated risks (like CVEs or internet ingress) in a single view. 3.  **CI/CD Integration**: Upwind connects production vulnerabilities back to the specific build, pull request, and developer who introduced them, streamlining the remediation process. 4.  **Process Baselining**: For their Jupyter notebook environments, which allow user-executed code, Upwind's ability to baseline normal process activity is crucial for detecting anomalous behavior like lateral movement or cryptomining. 5.  **Identity Security**: The platform provides a clear view of human and machine identities, mapping access from Okta and AWS SSO all the way to actions performed within the cloud, helping to enforce least privilege.

      "summary": "This lightning talk provides a concise but detailed overview of the advanced bot and fraud detection capabilities within AWS WAF. The session explains that since nearly half of all internet traffic is automated, distinguishing between good bots (like search engine crawlers) and bad bots (involved in content scraping, credential stuffing, etc.) is a critical security challenge. AWS WAF provides a suite of \"intelligent threat mitigation\" features to address this, moving beyond simple IP or signature-based blocking. The presentation focuses on two key areas: 1.  **Managed Rule Groups**: *   **Bot Control**: This rule group comes in two tiers. The *Common* level uses static analysis to identify and block unverified bots while allowing known good bots. The more advanced *Targeted* level uses sophisticated techniques like browser interrogation, device fingerprinting, and behavioral machine learning to detect and block evasive, automated browser bots (e.g., those built with Selenium). *   **Fraud Control**: This includes two specialized rule groups: **Account Takeover Prevention (ATP)**, which monitors login endpoints for credential stuffing attacks, and **Account Creation Fraud Prevention**, which protects registration pages from fake account creation. 2.  **Advanced Mitigation Actions**: *   **Challenge**: A silent, non-interactive action that sends a JavaScript challenge to the client's browser. The WAF analyzes the telemetry returned to verify that the client is a legitimate browser and not a simple script or automated tool. This process generates a token that is used for subsequent behavioral analysis. *   **CAPTCHA**: A user-facing puzzle that requires human interaction to solve, used as a stronger verification method. A series of demos showcases these features in action. First, a simple `curl` script is easily identified as an \"HTTP library\" by the Bot Control rule. Next, a more sophisticated Selenium script that programmatically emulates user behavior (logging in, adding to cart) is successfully detected as an \"automated browser\" by the Targeted Bot Control rules, even though it acquired a valid token. Finally, a credential stuffing attack against a login page is flagged by the Account Takeover Prevention rule group, which identifies the use of compromised credentials. The session concludes by emphasizing that these powerful, managed features allow customers to quickly deploy a sophisticated bot defense with minimal configuration.",

      "summary": "This deep-dive session explores scalable and resilient design patterns for network traffic inspection on AWS, focusing on the deployment and orchestration of services like AWS Network Firewall. The presentation begins by framing security as a layered approach, starting with in-VPC controls like Security Groups and NACLs, moving to VPC boundary inspection with Network Firewall and DNS Firewall, and finally to application protection with AWS WAF. The speakers emphasize that while basic controls are useful, customers often need to move to more advanced inspection for reasons of scale, inspection depth (e.g., FQDN filtering), and centralized management. The core of the talk is a detailed walkthrough of various inspection architectures for different traffic flows: intra-VPC, inter-VPC (east-west), hybrid, and internet ingress/egress. Two main deployment models are discussed: 1.  **Distributed Model**: Each VPC has its own dedicated firewall stack. This is common for ingress traffic or for isolated workloads requiring specific security policies. 2.  **Centralized Model**: A dedicated \"inspection VPC\" houses a shared fleet of firewalls, and traffic from multiple \"spoke\" VPCs is routed through it using AWS Transit Gateway or AWS Cloud WAN. This is the recommended pattern for east-west and egress traffic, as it simplifies management and policy enforcement. A key technical challenge addressed is maintaining stateful inspection and avoiding asymmetric routing, especially in multi-AZ deployments. The solution is to enable **Appliance Mode** on the Transit Gateway attachment for the inspection VPC. This ensures that for the life of a flow, both ingress and egress packets are routed through the same firewall endpoint, preserving state. The session culminates in a powerful customer case study of a large media streaming company that uses a centralized egress inspection architecture with AWS Network Firewall to handle **10 terabits per second** of traffic and hundreds of billions of daily connections. Their success hinges on a \"cell-based\" architecture, where they deploy multiple, independent \"egress cells\"—each consisting of a Transit Gateway and a set of Network Firewall endpoints—and distribute their workload VPCs across these cells. This allows for massive horizontal scaling, contains the blast radius of any potential failure, and provides a predictable cost model. Orchestration is managed centrally via AWS Firewall Manager, ensuring consistent rule deployment across all cells.",

      "summary": "This comprehensive session provides a masterclass on designing a defense-in-depth security architecture for internet-facing applications on AWS. The presentation is structured as a \"bad actor vs. defender\" role-play, where the attacker incrementally escalates their methods, and the defender responds by iteratively adding layers of protection using AWS security services. This format effectively demonstrates not just *what* services to use, but *why* and *when* to use them in response to specific threats. The security journey unfolds as follows: 1.  **Reconnaissance (Port Scans, Pings)**: The defender starts with foundational security, using **Security Groups** and **NACLs** to restrict traffic to only necessary ports (e.g., HTTPS/443). For broader protection, **AWS WAF** is added with geo-blocking and IP reputation lists to narrow the attack surface. 2.  **Volumetric DDoS (UDP Flood)**: The defender leverages the inherent scale of the AWS network and the automatic protections of **AWS Shield Standard**. For more advanced protection, **Shield Advanced** is enabled, providing L7 protection, DDoS response team (DRT) support, and cost protection against attack-driven scaling. 3.  **Application Layer DDoS (HTTP Flood)**: The attacker shifts to more sophisticated L7 floods. The defender responds with WAF rate-limiting rules. They also deploy **AWS WAF Bot Control** to distinguish between human and automated traffic, using advanced actions like `Challenge` (a silent JavaScript check) and `CAPTCHA` (a user-facing puzzle) to mitigate bots without blocking legitimate users. 4.  **Vulnerability Exploitation (Log4j)**: The attacker attempts to exploit a known CVE. The defender enables **AWS WAF Managed Rules**, specifically the \"Known bad inputs\" rule set, which contains signatures to block common exploit patterns like the one used for Log4j. 5.  **Data Exfiltration & C2 Communication**: The attacker, having gained a foothold, tries to exfiltrate data. The defender implements **AWS Network Firewall** in a centralized egress VPC. By configuring stateful FQDN filtering rules, they can block outbound connections to known malicious domains or, more restrictively, allowlist only known-good domains, preventing C2 callbacks and data exfiltration. The session also covers architectures for non-HTTP applications using **Network Load Balancer** and **Global Accelerator**, demonstrating how Network Firewall can be used for stateful inspection in these scenarios. A key best practice emphasized is the use of **AWS Firewall Manager** to centrally orchestrate and enforce these security policies across an entire AWS Organization, ensuring consistent protection for all accounts and applications.",

      "summary": "This session from Palo Alto Networks introduces a comprehensive, platform-based approach to securing the entire AI ecosystem, which they call \"AI Security by Design.\" The presentation addresses two primary use cases: first, securing employee access to external GenAI SaaS applications, and second, protecting the enterprise's own custom-built AI applications. The core message is that traditional security solutions are insufficient for the unique challenges of AI, and that organizations should extend their existing, familiar cybersecurity platforms rather than adding new point products. For the first use case—securing employee access—Palo Alto Networks is launching **AI Access Security**. This solution, integrated into their Next-Generation Firewalls and Prisma Access (SASE) platform, provides three key functions: 1.  **Visibility**: Discover and categorize all GenAI applications being used by employees in real-time. 2.  **Control**: Enforce granular access policies, defining which user groups can access which types of AI apps. 3.  **Data Governance**: Prevent the leakage of sensitive corporate data and intellectual property into public AI models through robust data control policies. For the second use case—protecting enterprise-built AI apps—they introduce a two-pronged solution: **AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM)** and **AI Runtime Security**. *   **AI-SPM** is designed to discover the entire AI application ecosystem (models, training data, infrastructure) and identify and prioritize risks related to misconfigurations, supply chain vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure ML libraries, vulnerable base models), and data governance. *   **AI Runtime Security** focuses on protecting the applications once they are deployed. This involves deep container microsegmentation, preventing known and zero-day threats, and crucially, addressing AI-specific attacks. It provides granular controls to protect the model itself from attacks like prompt injection and model denial-of-service, and it secures the data by sanitizing both inputs and outputs to prevent data leakage (like PII/PHI) or the injection of malicious content (like malicious URLs). The key differentiator emphasized throughout is the use of their proprietary **Precision AI**—a combination of deep learning, machine learning, and LLMs—to power their defenses, effectively using AI to protect AI.",

      "summary": "This comprehensive session provides a masterclass in securing REST APIs on AWS by applying the principles of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The presentation methodically addresses common API security challenges, such as those defined by the OWASP API Security Top 10, and maps them to specific AWS services and design patterns. The core message is that a robust API security posture requires a layered, defense-in-depth approach that covers identity, detection, infrastructure, and data protection. The session walks through several key security challenges and their corresponding solutions: 1.  **Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA)**: To solve this, the presentation emphasizes strong **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. For private APIs, this means using IAM resource policies on API Gateway and Lambda. For public APIs, **Amazon Cognito** is introduced as the identity provider, which can issue temporary IAM credentials to users, allowing fine-grained access control to backend resources like S3 buckets. **Amazon Verified Permissions** is also highlighted for defining application-specific authorization logic. 2.  **Security Misconfiguration & Unpatched Resources**: This is addressed through the **Detection** and **Infrastructure Protection** focus areas. Services like **Amazon CloudWatch** (for metrics and alarms), **AWS CloudTrail** (for API call logging), and **AWS Config** (for resource configuration history and compliance checks) are key for visibility. For vulnerability management, **Amazon Inspector** is used to continuously scan compute resources (EC2, Lambda, containers) for software vulnerabilities (CVEs) and network reachability issues. 3.  **Unrestricted Resource Consumption (Denial of Service)**: To protect against resource exhaustion and DDoS attacks, the session details a layered defense at the perimeter. This includes using **AWS Shield Advanced** for DDoS protection and, most importantly, leveraging **AWS WAF** with multiple layers of rules: *   **Rate-based rules** to limit requests from a single IP. *   **AWS Managed Rules** (like Core rule set and IP reputation list) for baseline protection. *   **Bot Control** and **Account Takeover Prevention (ATP)** rule groups to mitigate sophisticated automated threats. *   **Custom rules** with granular logic based on headers, query strings, or other request components. The session culminates with a customer story from **Twilio**, who built a sophisticated, automated solution to secure their APIs at scale. They developed an \"API Security Posture Dashboard\" and a \"WAF Automation Engine\" that programmatically discovers their APIs, assesses their security posture against predefined standards (e.g., is WAF enabled? is private DNS used?), and automatically deploys a baseline WAF configuration. This automation allowed them to move from securing 10 APIs manually to over 1,000 APIs automatically, drastically improving their security posture and operational efficiency.",

      "summary": "This session introduces **Cisco Multicloud Defense**, a cloud-native security solution designed to address the challenges of network visibility, segmentation, and consistent policy enforcement in complex, multi-cloud, and hybrid environments. The core problem highlighted is that organizations struggle to gain deep visibility into their cloud networks, leading to a patchwork of security tools and an inability to consistently apply security policies across different cloud providers. Cisco Multicloud Defense tackles this with a two-part architecture: 1.  **A SaaS-based Controller**: This is the central management plane where users define cloud-agnostic security policies and visualize their entire cloud estate. It provides a powerful topology view that aggregates information from all onboarded cloud accounts, showing what workloads are deployed where, what they are communicating with, and if they are communicating with known malicious destinations based on Cisco Talos threat intelligence. 2.  **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Gateways**: These are fully managed security gateways that are deployed directly into the customer's VPCs. Unlike traditional virtual firewalls, Cisco manages the deployment, scaling, and upgrading of these gateways, which leverage AWS-native constructs like Gateway Load Balancer and Transit Gateway. This allows the security to scale elastically with the application's needs. A key philosophical shift presented is moving from traditional IP-based security policies to a **tag-based policy model**. Instead of writing rules based on CIDR ranges, users apply policies to workloads based on their AWS tags (e.g., `env:prod`, `app:frontend`). This model is inherently more dynamic and cloud-native, and the policies are cloud-agnostic, allowing for consistent enforcement across AWS and other cloud providers. The solution provides ingress, egress (FQDN/URL filtering, C2 detection), and east-west (VPC-to-VPC) security, and recently announced support for AWS Cloud WAN to secure hybrid connectivity.",

      "summary": "This session provides a concise and practical guide to **Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall**, explaining how it can be used as a simple yet powerful layer of security to protect VPC workloads from malicious outbound connections. The presentation begins by highlighting that a significant majority (over 85%) of malware uses DNS for its operations, including command and control (C2) communication and data exfiltration, yet DNS security is often overlooked. DNS Firewall addresses this gap by providing a managed, highly available service to filter outbound DNS queries originating from within a VPC. The core of the solution is its seamless integration with the default Route 53 Resolver (the \".2\" address in every VPC). When enabled, all DNS queries are first inspected by the DNS Firewall before being forwarded to the resolver. This allows administrators to enforce policies without any architectural changes, like modifying route tables or deploying proxy fleets. The key features and implementation strategies covered are: 1.  **Rule-Based Filtering**: Administrators can create custom allow and deny lists based on domain names. They can also configure custom responses for blocked queries, such as `NXDOMAIN` (non-existent domain) or `NODATA`. 2.  **AWS Managed Domain Lists**: To simplify deployment, AWS provides managed lists that are continuously updated with threat intelligence. These include lists for known malware domains, botnet C2 servers, and an aggregated threats list. There is also a list provided in partnership with threat intelligence firm Recorded Future. 3.  **Centralized Management**: **AWS Firewall Manager** can be used to centrally deploy and manage DNS Firewall rules across an entire AWS Organization, ensuring consistent policy enforcement for all VPCs and accounts. 4.  **Visibility and Logging**: The service provides per-rule CloudWatch metrics and can send detailed query logs to S3, CloudWatch Logs, or Kinesis for analysis and monitoring. The recommended deployment strategy is a \"crawl, walk, run\" approach: start by enabling rules in \"alert\" mode in a single VPC to understand the potential impact, analyze the logs to identify any legitimate traffic that would be blocked, create necessary allow lists, and only then switch the rules to \"block\" mode before rolling out across the organization.",

      "author": " AWS Events",
      "summary": "This session makes a strong economic case for using **AWS WAF** to protect public-facing generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) applications from costly, automated traffic. The central argument is that while LLM inference can be expensive on a per-request basis, the cost of filtering traffic with AWS WAF is several orders of magnitude cheaper. This creates a significant opportunity for cost savings by blocking unwanted bot traffic at the edge before it ever reaches the expensive LLM backend. The presentation uses the example of an e-commerce website for bicycles that implements an LLM-powered chatbot to answer customer questions. To provide relevant answers, the application uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, which significantly increases the size of the input prompt sent to the model (e.g., from 19 words to over 1,200 words). This larger prompt size directly translates to higher inference costs with services like **Amazon Bedrock**. The speaker calculates that a single, complex request might cost around 0.6 cents. While this is a great return on investment for a legitimate customer, it becomes a major financial liability when subjected to automated bot traffic, which constitutes nearly half of all internet traffic. By deploying **AWS WAF Bot Control**, which is two orders of magnitude cheaper per request than the Bedrock inference, the speaker demonstrates a potential cost savings of **$277 for every $1 spent on WAF**, assuming 43% of traffic is malicious bots. The recommended architecture involves placing **Amazon CloudFront** in front of the application's load balancer. This provides performance benefits through caching and enhanced DDoS protection. AWS WAF is then attached to the CloudFront distribution, allowing it to inspect and block malicious requests at the edge. The key takeaway for developers and architects is to have security conversations concurrently with LLM application design and to leverage WAF not just as a security tool, but as a crucial cost-optimization mechanism.",

Using the analogy of a \"marble run,\" the presentation illustrates that security should act as intelligent guardrails that guide products safely to customers, not as a blocker that stops them entirely. AWS shares its internal philosophy for building secure services, centered on the \"Five Ps\": creating controls that are **Purposeful** (risk-based), developed in **Partnership** with engineers, **Painless** (ideally invisible) to use, **Provable** (easy to audit), and **Progressive** (iterative and continuously improved). The second half of the session features JPMC detailing their journey of building a secure and compliant public cloud platform on AWS at massive scale. Facing the challenge of managing over 6,000 AWS accounts and 2,000 applications, JPMC developed a centralized, automated governance framework called \"Firmament.\" This platform leverages a suite of AWS services to create a \"paved road\" for their developers. By automating account vending, baseline configurations, and the enforcement of preventative and detective guardrails, Firmament allows JPMC's developers to innovate quickly and safely within a secure, pre-approved environment. Their story serves as a powerful case study in how large, highly-regulated enterprises can embrace the public cloud without compromising on security and compliance.",

The core of the talk addresses the significant gap between impressive but fragile \"demo-ware\" and truly reliable, secure, and private AI-powered products. The presenter argues that many vendors, pressured to add AI capabilities, are shipping features that are slow, unreliable, and raise significant security and privacy concerns by sending customer data to third-party API providers. Tines initially faced this challenge head-on. Their first attempt at an AI feature, which used an external API, was met with immediate concern from customers about data privacy, even before it was released. The turning point came with the release of Anthropic's Claude 3 models on **Amazon Bedrock**. By shifting their architecture to use Bedrock via **AWS PrivateLink**, Tines was able to build AI features that operate entirely within their own secure AWS perimeter. This eliminated the need to send customer data over the internet, removed the requirement for a new third-party sub-processor, and leveraged the strong security guarantees of the AWS platform. The presenter concludes that by solving the security and privacy problem first, Tines was then able to build much more ambitious and powerful AI features, such as their new \"AI Action,\" which allows customers to confidently apply powerful language models to sensitive data within their automation workflows.",

The session begins by positioning Security Lake as a purpose-built, centralized data store for security logs, which normalizes data into the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format. The speakers clarify that while Splunk is a multi-function SIEM used for real-time threat detection and analysis, Security Lake excels at long-term, cost-effective data management. The core challenge addressed is that customers often store only a subset of their logs (like CloudTrail) in Splunk due to cost, leaving other valuable data (like VPC Flow Logs) in S3. The new Federated Analytics capability allows Splunk users to search and run detections on data stored in Security Lake directly from the Splunk UI, without having to first ingest and store that data in Splunk, thus providing a unified analytics experience across both \"hot\" data in Splunk and \"cold\" data in Security Lake.",
      "key_points": [
        "**Distinct Roles**: Splunk is positioned as the high-performance analytics and detection engine (the SIEM), while Amazon Security Lake is the cost-effective, long-term data store (the data lake).",
        "**The Data Gravity Problem**: Customers often only send their most critical, high-signal data to Splunk for real-time analysis due to storage costs, while vast amounts of lower-signal but forensically valuable data (e.g., VPC Flow Logs, WAF logs) remain in S3.",
        "**Bridging the Gap**: The new integration allows analysts to stay within the Splunk console to investigate threats, seamlessly querying data regardless of whether it resides in Splunk indexes or in Amazon Security Lake.",
        "**Two Modes of Operation**: The integration offers two main capabilities:",
        "**Powered by OCSF**: The entire integration is made possible because Security Lake normalizes all incoming data to the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF), which Splunk can natively understand and query against.",
        "**Use Cases**: Key use cases include long-term compliance data storage in Security Lake with searchability from Splunk, cost-effective threat hunting across massive datasets like VPC Flow Logs, and running Splunk's pre-built Enterprise Security content against data stored in AWS."

        "**Federated Search**: Allows a Splunk user to run an SPL query from the Splunk search bar that is translated and executed against data in Security Lake. The search results are returned to the Splunk UI, but the raw data remains in the lake. This is ideal for searching for a specific indicator (e.g., an IP address) across terabytes of historical logs.",
        "**Federated Analytics**:",
        "Users configure a \"provider\" in Splunk that subscribes to specific OCSF event classes (e.g., CloudTrail API activity, VPC network flows) in Security Lake.",
        "As new data arrives in Security Lake, it is streamed into a temporary, in-memory \"rolling window\" index in Splunk. This index is not persisted to disk.",
        "This temporary index looks and feels like a regular Splunk index, meaning existing Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) detections, dashboards, and ad-hoc SPL queries can be run against it seamlessly.",
        "This allows customers to apply Splunk's advanced analytics to data without paying to store it long-term in Splunk.",
        "**Out-of-the-Box Content**: Splunk is shipping a set of pre-built Enterprise Security detections that are ready to run against data brought in via Federated Analytics."

The speaker asserts that since breaches are inevitable, the primary goal should be to quickly contain an attack and stop lateral movement. The proposed solution is Zero Trust Segmentation, which operates on the principle of \"never trust, always verify\" for all communications. The presentation introduces Illumio CloudSecure, an agentless security tool for AWS that provides the visibility and control necessary to implement Zero Trust Segmentation. By ingesting VPC Flow Logs and AWS resource metadata, the tool builds a real-time application dependency map, showing exactly which workloads are communicating. This visibility allows security teams to understand their environment, identify anomalous traffic, and proactively author and enforce granular segmentation policies by programming Security Groups. This approach allows organizations to contain active attacks in real-time, giving them the breathing room needed for investigation and remediation without disrupting the entire environment.",

The presenters argue that in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, no single organization can defend itself alone. The goal is to move from a reactive \"firefighting\" posture to a proactive, and ultimately, a collective defense model. This is achieved by forming **trust communities** (often within the same industry sector) to share context-specific, actionable intelligence at machine speed. Using the Australian government's Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing (CTIS) program as a case study, the session demonstrates how this collaborative approach allows organizations to get ahead of threats and protect the entire community. The second half of the talk provides a detailed technical blueprint for building a CTI platform on AWS. It outlines how to deploy a platform like the open-source **OpenCTI**, integrate it with trust communities, and then use the ingested intelligence to automate both preventative and detective controls. Key services like **AWS Network Firewall**, **Route 53 DNS Firewall**, and **Amazon GuardDuty** can be automatically updated with threat intelligence to block malicious actors. The presenters emphasize the importance of centralizing and normalizing security data using **Amazon Security Lake** and the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) to enable effective threat hunting and analysis with tools like **Amazon Athena** and **Amazon SageMaker**.

      "summary": "This fast-paced session provides a practical \"survival guide\" for developers who need to navigate the world of cloud security. Framed around a simulated security incident—being locked out of an AWS account—the presenter walks through a developer-centric view of incident response and proactive threat mitigation. The core message is that for modern developers, security is not someone else's job; it's an integral part of the development lifecycle. The talk bridges the gap between development and security, offering actionable advice on how to respond to an active incident and then architect systems to prevent future ones. The first half of the presentation outlines a clear, step-by-step incident response checklist. It emphasizes immediately using **AWS CloudTrail** to answer the crucial \"who, what, where, and why\" of an incident. This is followed by a methodical process of restricting access, reviewing IAM users and roles, and leveraging **AWS Security Hub** to get a quick, prioritized overview of security vulnerabilities across the entire organization. The second half shifts to proactive threat mitigation, advocating for a \"secure by design\" approach. Key recommendations include using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for repeatable and auditable deployments, implementing least-privilege access patterns like S3 presigned URLs and IAM database authentication for RDS, and heavily favoring short-term credentials over long-lived IAM user access keys.",

The core of the session focuses on how established FinOps and CloudOps practices directly contribute to sustainability. The speakers emphasize shifting from a traditional data center mentality (over-provisioning) to a cloud-native one that embraces elasticity and cost optimization. They detail three key drivers for this: **rightsizing** (using appropriate instance types like Graviton3), **scheduling** (turning off resources when not in use), and implementing **lifecycle policies** (deleting unneeded data). By focusing on \"unit cost\"—the cost to deliver a specific business value—organizations can ensure that as their business grows, their resource consumption remains efficient.

Presented by leaders from Amazon's EPIC (Empathy, Purpose, Inspiration, Connection) Leadership program, the talk argues that as AI automates technical work, social and emotional skills are becoming the key differentiators for effective leaders. Citing high rates of burnout and stress in the cybersecurity industry, the presenters make a neuroscience-backed case that emotions are not a distraction from work, but are in fact data that directly impacts attention, decision-making, creativity, and performance. The core message is that leaders who can understand and regulate their own emotions—and create an environment of psychological safety for their teams—are better equipped to foster innovation and resilience. The presentation provides practical, actionable techniques for leaders to enhance their EQ. These include simple but powerful methods for managing stress, such as practicing gratitude and using controlled breathing exercises (like the \"box breath\" used by Navy SEALs) to maintain cognitive efficiency under pressure. The session culminates in a case study of a fictional security leader, \"Bob,\" who uses empathy and perspective-seeking to address burnout on his team. By having authentic conversations, understanding his team's personal challenges, and implementing practical changes like equitable on-call schedules, Bob transforms his team's culture from one of stress to one of empowerment and high performance.

      "summary": "This session tells the story of how KirkpatrickPrice, a licensed CPA firm and security assessor, navigated its cloud journey from a single server closet to a multi-account AWS environment, all while maintaining a small operational team. The core challenge was managing exponential growth and increasing complexity without increasing headcount. The solution was a strategic adoption of serverless containers with **AWS Fargate** and a comprehensive observability and security platform from **Datadog**. By moving to Fargate, KirkpatrickPrice offloaded the undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing the underlying worker nodes of their container clusters, allowing their small team to focus on the application and container level. However, this shift to an abstracted compute layer created a new visibility challenge. To solve this, they implemented Datadog's full-stack platform. The session details how KirkpatrickPrice uses **Datadog Cloud SIEM** to monitor their AWS organizational trail, **Cloud Security Management** to secure the containers themselves, and **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)** to link security signals with application performance. This unified approach provides their small team with a single pane of glass, enabling them to correlate events across the entire stack, from cloud infrastructure to application code. The key takeaway is that by combining the operational efficiency of AWS Fargate with the deep, correlated insights from Datadog, even small teams can confidently manage and secure a complex, growing cloud environment.",

      "summary": "In this partner session, the CEO of security startup **Zafran** argues that traditional vulnerability management, focused on patching, is a losing battle against modern threats. Citing the massive volume of CVEs, the rapid weaponization of exploits (sometimes within hours), and recent high-profile breaches like the Microsoft test environment compromise, the speaker makes the case for evolving from simple patch management to a more intelligent, context-aware risk mitigation strategy. The core problem, as presented, is that security teams are overwhelmed and cannot \"boil the ocean\" by patching every vulnerability, while attackers are adept at finding the unpatched cracks and unprotected systems. The solution proposed by Zafran is a platform that shifts the focus from a raw vulnerability count to an \"applicable risk\" score. Their agentless platform connects to an organization's existing security tools (EDR, vulnerability scanners, posture management) and enriches the data through a multi-stage analysis process. This process prioritizes vulnerabilities by first determining if the vulnerable software is actually running, if the asset is internet-facing, and if the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild. Crucially, it then assesses whether existing **compensating controls** (like an EDR or a WAF) are already mitigating the risk, even if the patch hasn't been applied. By understanding where security controls are effective and where the gaps are, Zafran aims to provide a highly focused list of truly exploitable risks and automates the deployment of upstream mitigations (e.g., a network rule) to protect thousands of assets at once, buying valuable time for patching.",

        "**Focus on Applicable Risk, Not Raw Vulnerabilities**: A vulnerability's CVSS score is just a base risk. The true \"applicable risk\" is much lower once you factor in context like: Is the software running? Is the asset internet-exposed? And most importantly, is the risk already mitigated by an existing compensating control?",
        "**Leverage Existing Controls**: Many organizations have invested heavily in security tools (EDR, WAF, network firewalls), but they don't factor the protection these tools provide into their vulnerability prioritization. A key part of the solution is validating these controls and using them to mitigate risk without immediate patching.",
        "**Mitigation Graph**: Zafran has built a proprietary \"mitigation graph,\" powered by generative AI, that maps vulnerabilities to specific attack vectors and then to the security controls that can effectively block them.",

The presentation chronicles their evolution from on-premises tools to building their own bespoke cloud controls, to adopting a third-party cloud-agnostic solution, and finally, to standardizing on native services like **AWS Security Hub** and **Amazon Inspector**. The core challenge NatWest faced was managing the complexity, cost, and operational overhead of their security tooling as their AWS estate grew from tens to thousands of accounts. The speaker provides a candid look at the pain points of their previous approaches, including the high cost and API \"log bloat\" from their third-party CSPM tool, and the management burden of a traditional agent-based vulnerability scanner. Their decision to adopt Security Hub and Inspector was driven by the desire for a more integrated, cost-effective, and operationally efficient solution. NatWest details their implementation strategy, including a phased rollout, the creation of a centralized data lake for findings, and the development of custom dashboards in QuickSight to provide business-unit-specific views for their application teams.

The presentation moves beyond theoretical best practices to reveal what companies are *actually* doing, highlighting significant gaps between recommended security postures and on-the-ground reality. The survey covers a wide range of topics, including documentation usage, risk assessment, access methods, and the adoption rates of key AWS security services. The findings reveal a mixed landscape. While foundational services like Amazon GuardDuty see relatively high adoption, more advanced or complex services like AWS Shield Advanced, AWS Control Tower, and AWS Security Hub show significantly lower usage. A key insight is that many organizations treat their AWS environment like a traditional on-premises data center, focusing on infrastructure-level protection but neglecting the security *inside* the instance and failing to leverage cloud-native security services effectively. The presenters use their data to issue a call to action, urging companies to use the report as a benchmark to justify security improvements and to fully embrace the powerful, often easy-to-enable, security features that AWS provides.",

      "summary": "This practical session delivers direct, actionable advice on how to secure Amazon S3 data while also managing costs effectively. The speaker, a community hero, argues that S3 security is not just about preventing data loss but also about defending against \"denial-by-wallet\" attacks, where an attacker drives up a victim's S3 bill by creating numerous large object versions. The talk is split into two main sections: cost optimization using S3 Intelligent-Tiering and data protection using S3 Object Lock. The first part of the session makes a strong case for using **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** as the default storage class. The speaker highlights a critical but often misunderstood detail: unlike standard infrequent access storage classes, the infrequent access *tier* within Intelligent-Tiering does not incur a data retrieval fee. This makes Intelligent-Tiering a financially safer choice for data with unknown or unpredictable access patterns, protecting organizations from massive, unexpected bills if they suddenly need to retrieve large volumes of data. The second half focuses on **S3 Object Lock** as the ultimate defense against data deletion or ransomware. The speaker explains the difference between Governance Mode (which allows deletion with a special permission) and Compliance Mode (which makes deletion impossible for anyone, including the root user). A key takeaway is the \"horror story\" of a company that accidentally applied a seven-year Compliance Mode lock to petabytes of test data, locking them into a massive, unchangeable bill. The session concludes with a clear, safe call to action for implementing Object Lock: start with a short retention period in Governance Mode, monitor for breakage, and only then move to Compliance Mode with a reasonably short, auto-extending retention period.",

This \"paperwork problem\" creates friction, delays, and often prevents smaller businesses from getting the coverage they need. The AWS Cyber Insurance Competency program addresses this by connecting customers with a curated set of cloud-ready insurance partners (brokers, MGAs, and direct insurers) who have created a streamlined, data-driven application process. Instead of filling out a 60-page questionnaire, an AWS customer can now answer a few high-level questions and then, with their consent, securely share their security posture data directly from **AWS Security Hub**. Based on this real data, the insurance partner can provide a no-obligation quote for a comprehensive policy within two business days.

      "summary": "In this session, the Chief Product Officer for Cloud Security at Tenable argues that traditional, siloed approaches to cloud security are insufficient for managing modern risks. The core problem, he explains, is not individual vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or excessive permissions in isolation, but the \"toxic combinations\" where these risks intersect to create a clear and present danger. Citing Tenable's research, the speaker reveals that 40% of organizations have a scenario where a publicly exposed compute resource has a critical vulnerability and also has privileged access to sensitive data—a perfect storm for a breach. The presentation makes a strong case for a modern Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) that looks holistically across the entire cloud environment. By unifying context from workload scanning (CWPP), posture management (CSPM), and identity entitlement management (CIEM), a CNAPP can automatically identify and prioritize these high-risk toxic combinations, allowing security teams to focus their limited resources on the threats that matter most.",

        "**Widespread Exposure**: Tenable's research indicates that 40% of organizations have these toxic combinations, creating an easily exploitable attack path from the internet to sensitive data.",
        "**The Problem with Silos**: Traditional security tools that look at vulnerabilities, network posture, and IAM permissions separately fail to connect the dots and identify these high-impact risk chains, overwhelming teams with alerts that lack proper context for prioritization.",
        "**A Unified CNAPP is the Solution**: The talk advocates for a modern CNAPP approach that integrates data from across the cloud stack to provide rich context. This allows for the automatic discovery and prioritization of toxic combinations.",
        "**Context-Driven Prioritization**: A unified platform can dynamically adjust the severity of a finding. For example, a vulnerability's severity is elevated to critical if the host is also exposed to the internet and has high privileges. Remediating one part of the toxic chain (e.g., removing public access) will automatically de-prioritize the other related findings."

      "summary": "In this practical session, an experienced penetration tester tackles the ongoing debate between manual and automated security testing. The speaker argues against the extreme views that either \"automation is all you need\" or that \"all automated reports are bad.\" Instead, she advocates for a hybrid approach that combines the best of both worlds to achieve the ultimate goal: effective risk management. The presentation highlights that while automated scanners are incredibly fast and efficient at finding known vulnerabilities and \"low-hanging fruit,\" they have significant blind spots. Scanners can miss business logic flaws, fail when they encounter authentication issues, and cannot demonstrate the real-world impact of a vulnerability through lateral movement. The core of the talk proposes a \"why not both?\" philosophy. The speaker shares her personal workflow, where she uses automation not just for initial scanning but also for report generation. By separating data from formatting, she can automatically generate the repetitive parts of a penetration test report (like vulnerability descriptions and remediation advice) while dedicating her time to the high-value manual tasks: validating findings, eliminating false positives, testing for logic flaws, and demonstrating the business impact of an exploit chain. This hybrid model allows for a more efficient and effective penetration test, delivering a higher quality result for the customer by focusing human expertise where it matters most.",

The session paints a picture of a rapidly evolving threat landscape where attackers are moving faster than ever (with breakout times as short as two minutes), increasingly using stolen credentials to \"log in\" rather than \"break in,\" and leveraging native OS tools to evade detection. The panelists agree that securing generative AI is not just about protecting the model itself, but securing the entire ecosystem it operates in—the data pipelines, the supply chain, the underlying cloud infrastructure, and the identities accessing it. They emphasize the need for a comprehensive, platform-centric approach to security that breaks down traditional silos between endpoint, cloud, and identity protection. The discussion highlights how AI can empower security operations by automating threat hunting, summarizing complex incidents into natural language, and providing guided remediation steps, ultimately freeing up human analysts to focus on the most critical threats.

The core of Meta's strategy revolves around a sophisticated and highly automated use of AWS Organizations and, most critically, Service Control Policies (SCPs). The presentation details their specific Organizational Unit (OU) structure, which is designed to enforce different security postures based on an account's purpose, such as `Prod`, `Dev`, `Sandbox`, `Lockdown` (for incidents), and `Suspended`. The session goes beyond standard OU design to explain Meta's innovative use of *dynamic* SCPs. To meet strict global privacy requirements, every AWS service that can store or process data must be explicitly approved for use on a per-account basis. Meta has built a system that dynamically generates and attaches custom SCPs to each account, explicitly allowing only the approved services for that account's specific use case. This creates a powerful deny-by-default posture that minimizes the blast radius of any potential compromise. The talk also covers how this SCP-based automation is leveraged for rapid incident response—automatically moving a compromised account to a `Lockdown` OU to sever network access—and to guide developers to a \"paved path\" by detecting denied actions and providing real-time feedback.",

The presentation addresses the core challenge of modern data analysis: the need to derive collective insights (e.g., for joint marketing campaigns or AI model training) while protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and preventing re-identification of individuals. The speaker illustrates that simply stripping PII often destroys the data's utility, making it impossible to perform meaningful analysis like matching mutual customers between two companies. AWS Clean Rooms is presented as a solution that creates a secure collaboration environment where multiple parties can contribute their data. Instead of moving or revealing the raw data, participants can run joint SQL queries under a set of configurable **analysis rules**. These rules enforce privacy-enhancing controls, such as only allowing aggregated results, enforcing a minimum threshold of individuals to prevent singling someone out, or enabling a \"blind match\" on a join key without exposing the key itself.

      "summary": "This deep and conceptual session, led by Neha Rungta, Applied Science Director for AWS Identity, explores how AWS uses **automated reasoning**—a branch of computer science that applies mathematical logic to verify software correctness—to provide \"provable security\" for its services. Drawing an analogy to how the Pythagorean theorem was mathematically proven to be true for all possible triangles, Rungta explains that the same formal methods can be used to prove that a software implementation correctly adheres to its intended specification for all possible inputs. The presentation details how this approach is applied to critical AWS security features. For **Amazon S3 Block Public Access**, automated reasoning is used to mathematically prove that a given bucket policy will never grant public access. This is achieved by translating the policy and the definition of \"public\" into formal logic and then using a theorem prover to verify the property across all infinitely possible requests in milliseconds. The most significant application discussed is the IAM authorization engine itself. Rungta reveals that AWS has deployed a **proven correct version of the IAM authorization engine**, which processes billions of requests per second. Using automated reasoning, they have formally proven that the engine's code correctly implements the fundamental principles of IAM policy evaluation, such as \"an explicit deny always overrides an allow.\" This provides the highest level of assurance for the core of AWS's access control system. The session concludes by introducing **Cedar**, a new open-source policy language and engine born from these efforts. Cedar is designed to be ergonomic, analyzable, and performant, allowing developers to build provably secure authorization into their own applications. Because Cedar was built from the ground up with formal verification in mind, developers can use its tooling to analyze policies, validate them against schemas, and ensure their applications' access control logic is behaving exactly as intended.",

The speakers explain that customers often struggle with the manual effort required to correctly configure AWS services (like GuardDuty, CloudTrail, etc.) to feed data into their chosen security tools (e.g., from CrowdStrike, Sumo Logic, Wiz). The AWS Built-in program addresses this by providing pre-built, validated, and automated Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates that handle this foundational setup. The program involves a \"co-build\" process where AWS works with ISV partners to create these templates, which are then rigorously validated through an automated pipeline before being published. The ultimate goal is to remove the operational burden from customers, ensure integrations follow AWS best practices, and allow customers to get value from their security tools on day one.",

      "summary": "In this partner session, security vendor CrowdStrike provides a comprehensive overview of how their Falcon Cloud Security platform addresses the complex challenges of securing modern containerized environments on AWS. The presentation begins by outlining the current threat landscape, highlighting the increasing speed and sophistication of cloud-focused adversaries, with breakout times (time from initial access to lateral movement) dropping to as little as a few minutes. The talk then pivots to the unique challenges of container security, emphasizing the scale, churn, and complexity of managing vulnerabilities and configurations across the entire container lifecycle. The core of the presentation details how the Falcon platform provides a unified solution that covers the entire lifecycle, from pre-runtime to runtime. In the pre-runtime or \"shift-left\" phase, Falcon offers multiple methods for image assessment, including a local analysis tool for developers, automated scanning within CI/CD pipelines, and dynamic analysis (sandboxing) for untrusted images. For the runtime phase, CrowdStrike emphasizes the importance of continuous registry scanning to detect newly discovered vulnerabilities in running images. A key component of their runtime protection is the **Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller**, a validating webhook that enforces security policies to block the deployment of containers that violate predefined rules, such as having critical CVEs. The session includes a detailed demo showcasing how to set up registry scanning for Amazon ECR, create a policy to block critical vulnerabilities, and then see that policy in action, preventing a `kubectl` command from deploying a vulnerable pod.",

      "summary": "In this session, a security architecture director from Varonis makes a compelling case for why organizations need to adopt an automated Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) strategy to protect their most critical asset: data. The speaker argues that while AWS is incredibly flexible, this flexibility creates significant risk, leading to data sprawl, complex permissions, and \"toxic combinations\" of misconfigurations and excessive access that can lead to major breaches. The core problem, he explains, is that infrastructure-focused security tools often lack data context, making it impossible to prioritize risks effectively. An exposed database is a security incident, but an exposed database containing millions of sensitive health records is a potential catastrophe. The presentation emphasizes that manual efforts and periodic scans are insufficient to keep up with the dynamic nature of the cloud. The solution is an automated DSPM platform that provides a complete, contextual, and current picture of data risk. This involves continuously discovering and classifying sensitive data, analyzing who has access to it (and who *shouldn't*), monitoring how it's being used, and detecting threats in real time. By automating the discovery of sensitive data, the remediation of excessive permissions, and the detection of anomalous behavior, organizations can move from a reactive to a proactive security posture, effectively reducing their data breach \"blast radius.\"",
      "key_points": [
        "**Data is the Target**: Security should be data-centric. Despite investments in endpoint and perimeter security, data breaches still happen because the data itself is often the \"soft gooey center\" of an organization.",
        "**Security Incident vs. Data Breach**: A key distinction is the ability to prove whether data was actually compromised. A misconfiguration (a security incident) only becomes a confirmed data breach if you cannot prove that the exposed data wasn't accessed by an unauthorized party. DSPM provides the necessary audit trail to make this distinction.",
        "**The Blast Radius**: 99% of cloud permissions are unused. This excess access represents the \"blast radius\"—the total potential damage an attacker could do with a single compromised identity. Reducing this is a primary goal of DSPM.",
        "**Context is King**: A DSPM solution's main value is correlating infrastructure posture with data sensitivity. This allows teams to prioritize fixing a misconfiguration on a database with PII over a similar issue on a test server with public data.",
        "**Automation is Non-Negotiable**: Due to the sheer volume of data, identities, permissions, and constant change in the cloud, manual security efforts will always fall short. Automation is the only way to continuously manage risk and technical debt."

      "summary": "This technical session presents a practical use case for generative AI in security operations: automating the creation of security incident response runbooks. The presenter begins by outlining the common challenges with manual runbook creation, noting that it's a time-consuming process that often results in generic, out-of-date documentation that lacks organization-specific context. The proposed solution uses a serverless architecture centered around AWS Security Hub and Amazon Bedrock to address these issues. The architecture uses Security Hub findings as a trigger. When a new finding is generated (e.g., \"EBS default encryption should be enabled\"), an EventBridge rule invokes a Lambda function. This function takes the finding details and combines them with a curated knowledge base using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. The knowledge base, indexed by Amazon Kendra, contains company-specific information such as application design documents and standard runbook templates, as well as official AWS documentation. The Lambda function then prompts a foundation model in Amazon Bedrock to generate a detailed, context-aware runbook. The final output is a completed runbook, populated with specific technical steps from AWS docs and tailored to the organization's format, which can then be used to create a ticket in an ITSM tool for a security engineer to action.",

      "summary": "In this executive panel discussion, leaders from AWS and Intuit explore the critical components of building a \"culture of security\"—an environment where security is not just the CISO's problem, but a shared responsibility across the entire organization. The session differentiates this from \"security culture\" (the culture *within* the security team), focusing instead on how to embed a security-first mindset into the company's DNA. The panelists argue that in an era of infinite risks and limited security resources, the only scalable model is to empower and enable the rest of the business to own its security decisions. This requires a fundamental shift for security teams, moving from being the \"Department of No\" to becoming a trusted partner and business accelerator. The conversation outlines a maturity model for security organizations, from reactive and centralized to a proactive, federated model where security provides the \"paved road\" for developers. Key building blocks for achieving this culture include top-down executive sponsorship where the CEO and board are actively engaged, speaking the language of the business (e.g., framing security in terms of ROI and risk reduction), and creating a great \"user experience\" for developers who consume security services. The panelists share real-world examples from Amazon and Intuit, such as embedding security engineers directly into service teams, celebrating security wins, and creating review mechanisms like the \"Correction of Errors\" (COE) process to learn from failures without blame.
