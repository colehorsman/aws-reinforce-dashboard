## üîß Common Improvements Needed

### Response Enhancement Patterns:
1. **Always include numbers**: "IAM grew 113% with 32 sessions in 2025 vs 15 in 2024"
2. **Add business context**: "This growth reflects increasing focus on machine identities"
3. **Provide next steps**: "Consider implementing Cedar policy language for fine-grained access control"
4. **Reference real sessions**: "As discussed in session IAM441 on securing AI agents"

### CISO-Specific Language:
- Use "strategic priorities" not "topics"
- Use "risk mitigation" not "security measures"  
- Use "business enablement" not "security features"
- Use "threat landscape evolution" not "new attacks"
